Evaluator mapping see `main.py`. 

**Note** that `summ_comparison` and `attributed_eval` involve llm_judge and may require major revision to adapt to your workflow. The code was redundant and written for OpenAI batch jobs. 

`attributed_eval` and `fact_checking` have tuple output of 2 scores, others have 1.
