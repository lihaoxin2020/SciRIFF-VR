Question asking is one way in which patients can be active. We investigated 2 means of promoting cancer patient question asking. One was the provision of a question prompt sheet to patients prior to their initial consultation with their oncologist. The second was the active endorsement and systematic review of the question prompt sheet by their oncologist. 318 patients with heterogeneous cancers, seeing one of 5 medical and 4 radiation oncologists for the first time, were randomised to either receive or not receive a question prompt sheet. Doctors were randomised to either proactively address or passively respond to the question prompt sheet in the subsequent consultation. Anxiety was assessed prior to the consultation. Consultations were audiotaped and content analysed. Anxiety was assessed again immediately following the consultation. Within the next 10 days patients completed questionnaires assessing information needs, anxiety and satisfaction and were given a structured telephone interview assessing information recall. Patients provided with a question prompt sheet asked more questions about prognosis compared with controls and oncologists gave significantly more prognostic information to these patients. Provision of the question prompt sheet prolonged consultations and increased patient anxiety; however, when oncologists specifically addressed the prompt sheet, anxiety levels were significantly reduced, consultation duration was decreased and recall was significantly improved.

Brief advice was delivered during routine consultation by the practitioner after an onsite training session. Both interventions were based on the Transtheoretical Model of behaviour change.\n\nABSTRACT.MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported point prevalence and prolonged abstinence at 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-month follow-ups.\n\nABSTRACT.FINDINGS: Among participants completing the last follow-up, 6-month prolonged abstinence was 18.3% in the tailored letters intervention group, 14.8% in the brief advice intervention group and 10.5% in the assessment-only control group. Assuming those lost to follow-up to be smokers, the rates were 10.2%, 9.7% and 6.7%, respectively. Analyses including all follow-ups confirmed statistically significant effects of both interventions compared to assessment only. Using complete case analysis, the tailored letters intervention was significantly more effective than brief advice for 24-hour [odds ratio (OR) = 1.4; P = 0.047] but not for 7-day point prevalence abstinence (OR = 1.4; P = 0.068) for prolonged abstinence, or for alternative assumptions about participants lost to follow-up.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated long-term efficacy of low-cost interventions for smoking cessation in general practice.

[Subjects and Methods] The subjects of\nthe present study were 30 elderly chronic-constipation sufferers who resided in a nursing\nhome and had other physical conditions that necessitated wheelchair ambulation. There were\nthree test groups in the present study: an silver spike point group, an acupuncture group,\nand a control group; 10 subjects were assigned to each group. The silver spike point group\nand the acupuncture group received their respective interventions, which were applied to\nboth sides of the Tiensu for 20 minutes per day, five days per week, over a four week\nperiod. Weekly bowel movement frequency was recorded, and the Constipation Assessment\nScale and Bowel Function Assessment Form were used as data-gathering instruments.\n[Results] Following treatment, the silver spike point and acupuncture groups showed\nsignificant improvement, based on the Constipation Assessment Scale and the Bowel Function\nAssessment Form, compared with the control group.

Yet, no trials have examined the effects of vitamin D supplementation on NFκB activity in-vivo in humans. We conducted a double-blind randomized trial (RCT) examining effects of vitamin D supplementation on inflammatory markers and NFκB activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Sixty-five overweight/obese, vitamin D-deficient (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] ≤ 50 nmol/L) adults were randomized to a single 100,000 IU bolus followed by 4,000 IU daily cholecalciferol or matching placebo for 16 weeks. We measured BMI, % body fat, serum 25(OH)D, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), tumour necrosis factor (TNF), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), several interleukins, and NFκB activity in PBMCs. Fifty-four participants completed the study. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations increased with vitamin D supplementation compared to placebo (p < 0.001). Vitamin D and placebo groups did not differ in any inflammatory markers or NFκB activity (all p > 0.05). Results remained non-significant after adjustment for age, sex, and % body fat, and after further adjustment for sun exposure, physical activity, and dietary vitamin D intake.

This study aimed to compare HRQOL in patients with advanced gastric cancer (GC) receiving either a standard or an experimental treatment.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Seventy-one patients have been treated in Cancer Institute (Tehran, Iran) with docetaxel, cisplatin, 5 FU (TCF) or epirubicin, cisplatin, 5-FU (ECF) and were followed from Jan 2002 to Jan 2005. End points were response rate, HRQOL and survival. HRQOL was assessed using the EORCT QLQ-C30 at baseline and after the third cycle of chemotherapy.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The baseline HRQOL scores were comparable between two groups. After treatment improvement was seen in a number of items and domains except for cognitive functioning, and diarrhoea. Pain decreased and physical functioning improved in both groups. However, only the TCF group showed statistically and clinically meaningful improvement in global QOL (P = 0.001). Surgical and pathologic response was better with TCF but there was no difference in survival rate between two groups.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Docetaxel based treatment (TCF) showed better palliation and improvement of global QOL as compared with epirubicin based treatment (ECF). However, it seems that regardless of treatment offered, effective chemotherapy was the most important factor affecting QOL in these patients.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"docetaxel, cisplatin, 5 FU (TCF)\", \"epirubicin, cisplatin, 5-FU (ECF)\", \"quality of life\", \"significantly increased\", \"However, only the TCF group showed statistically and clinically meaningful improvement in global QOL (P = 0.001).\"], [\"docetaxel, cisplatin, 5 FU (TCF)\", \"epirubicin, cisplatin, 5-FU (ECF)\", \"survival rate\", \"no significant difference\", \"there was no difference in survival rate between two groups.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

We investigated the effect of astaxanthin (Asx) supplementation on salivary IgA (sIgA) and oxidative stress status in plasma, along with changes in biochemical parameters and total/differential white cell counts. Forty trained male soccer players were randomly assigned to Asx and placebo groups. Asx group was supplemented with 4 mg of Asx. Saliva and blood samples were collected at the baseline and after 90 days of supplementation in preexercise conditions. We observed a rise of sIgA levels at rest after 90 days of Asx supplementation, which was accompanied with a decrease in prooxidant-antioxidant balance. The plasma muscle enzymes levels were reduced significantly by Asx supplementation and by regular training. The increase in neutrophil count and hs-CRP level was found only in placebo group, indicating a significant blunting of the systemic inflammatory response in the subjects taking Asx. This study indicates that Asx supplementation improves sIgA response and attenuates muscle damage, thus preventing inflammation induced by rigorous physical training. Our findings also point that Asx could show significant physiologic modulation in individuals with mucosal immunity impairment or under conditions of increased oxidative stress and inflammation.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"placebo (P group)\", \"baseline\", \"neutrophil count\", \"significantly increased\", \"The increase in neutrophil count and hs-CRP level was found only in placebo group,\"], [\"4 mg of astaxanthin (Asx) \", \"baseline\", \"neutrophil count\", \"no significant difference\", \"The increase in neutrophil count and hs-CRP level was found only in placebo group,\"], [\"placebo (P group)\", \"baseline\", \"high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)\", \"significantly increased\", \".

After bonding a bracket on each tooth, the groups one to four were stored in artificial saliva at a pH of 3.8, 4.8, 5.8, and 6.8, respectively for two months. The artificial saliva solutions were refreshed weekly. Each tooth was then embedded in an acrylic block so that the crown was exposed and its buccal surface was parallel to the direction of the force during SBS testing. All brackets were debonded using Dartec universal testing machine, and the mean values of SBS in different groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: The mean SBS value in group one (pH 3.8) was significantly lower than that in other groups (P<0.05).

The arthritis-specific Work Productivity Survey (WPS) assessed the impact of PsA on paid work and household productivity, and participation in social activities during the preceding month. WPS responses were compared between treatment arms using a non-parametric bootstrap-t method.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: At baseline, 56.6%, 60.1% and 61.5% of placebo, CZP 200 mg Q2W and CZP 400 mg Q4W patients were employed. By week 24, employed CZP patients reported an average of 1.0–1.8 and 3.0–3.9 fewer days of absenteeism and presenteeism, respectively, per month compared with 1.0 and 0.3 fewer days for placebo patients (p<0.05). Within the home, by week 24, CZP patients reported an average of 3.0–3.5 household work days gained per month versus 1.0 day for placebo (p<0.05). CZP patients also reported fewer days with reduced household productivity or days lost for participation in family, social and leisure activities. Improvements with CZP were seen as early as week 4 and continued to week 24.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: CZP treatment significantly improved productivity at paid work and within the home, and resulted in greater participation in social activities for PsA patients.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01087788.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"CZP 200 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or CZP 400 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W)\", \"Placebo\", \"absenteeism and presenteeism\", \"significantly decreased\", \"employed CZP patients reported an average of 1.0\\u20131.8 and 3.0\\u20133.9 fewer days of absenteeism and presenteeism, respectively, per month compared with 1.0 and 0.3 fewer days for placebo patients (p\\u003c0.05).\"], [\"CZP 200 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or CZP 400 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W)\", \"placebo\", \"household work days\", \"significantly increased\", \"CZP patients reported an average of 3.0\\u20133.5 household work days gained per month versus 1.0 day for placebo (p\\u003c0.05).\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:101"}, "target": "[[\"CZP 200 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or CZP 400 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W)\", \"Placebo\", \"absenteeism and presenteeism\", \"significantly decreased\", \"employed CZP patients reported an average of 1.0\\u20131.8 and 3.0\\u20133.9 fewer days of absenteeism and presenteeism, respectively, per month compared with 1.0 and 0.3 fewer days for placebo patients (p\\u003c0.05).\"], [\"CZP 200 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or CZP 400 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W)\", \"placebo\", \"household work days\", \"significantly increased\", \"CZP patients reported an average of 3.0\\u20133.5 household work days gained per month versus 1.0 day for placebo (p\\u003c0.05).\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

The purpose of this study was evaluation of effect of Semelil (ANGIPARSTM), a new herbal drug for treatment of diabetic foot ulcers or diabetic peripheral neuropathy.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: In this double blind clinical trial, 49 type 2 diabetes patients with different degrees of neuropathy were evaluated in two groups (ANGIPARSTM and placebo groups). All patients were assessed at the start and 12 weeks after treatment, with laboratory tests, United Kingdom screening test, Michigan neuropathy screening score, Michigan diabetic neuropathy score, vibration perception thresholds, nerve conduction study, monofilament test and visual analog scale.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Michigan diabetic neuropathy score was decreased notably in ANGIPARSTM group. In the nerve conduction study, appropriate meaningful changes were observed in the distal latency and amplitude in the motor Ulnar nerve in ANGIPARSTM group.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: The results showed limited evidence of efficacy of ANGIPARSTM in diabetic neuropathy treatment and more studies with a larger sample size and longer duration are required.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Semelil (ANGIPARSTM)\", \"Placebo\", \"Michigan diabetic neuropathy score\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Michigan diabetic neuropathy score was decreased notably in ANGIPARSTM group.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Patients received vilazodone 40 mg/d or placebo; post hoc analyses were conducted on study completers. Depression symptom improvement was evaluated by analyzing the proportions of patients who shifted from the baseline MADRS single-item symptom severity category of ≥ 2 (mild to severe symptoms) to an end-of-study category < 2 (minimal to no symptoms) or from ≥ 4 (moderate to severe symptoms) to ≤ 2 (mild to no symptoms). The proportion of patients who shifted from anxious depression to no anxious depression was also analyzed. <p> Results: The percentage of patients who completed these studies with severity category shift from baseline ≥ 2 to end of study < 2 was significantly higher for vilazodone versus placebo on all MADRS items (odds ratio [OR] range, 1.4–1.7, P < .05) except reduced appetite (OR = 1.3, P = .232).

Included were postmenopausal women with vaginal atrophy symptoms and Vaginal Maturation Index (VMI) of ≤ 40%. The method of treatment was initial therapy with test medication (or placebo in first phase), one vaginal tablet daily for 12 days, followed by maintenance therapy, one tablet on two consecutive days weekly for 12 weeks.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:  A total of 87 women completed the study. The Controlled phase results for a change in VMI demonstrated superiority of the 0.03 mg estriol–lactobacilli combination to placebo (p < 0.001). In the test group, the positive change in VMI was 35.2%, compared to 9.9% in the placebo group. In the Open phase after the initial therapy, the VMI was increased to 55.4% and, during maintenance therapy, it stayed at a comparable level (52.8–49.4%). The maturation of epithelium was followed by improvement of clinical symptoms and normalization of the vaginal ecosystem.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:  The ultra-low-dose, vaginal 0.03 mg estriol–lactobacilli combination (Gynoflor®) was superior to placebo with respect to changes in VMI after the 12-day initial therapy, and the maintenance therapy of two tablets weekly was sufficient to prevent the relapse of vaginal atrophy.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"Vaginal estriol plus viable Lactobacillus acidophilus KS400 \", \"Placebo\", \"Improvement in Vaginal Maturation Index\", \"significantly increased\", \"The Controlled phase results for a change in VMI demonstrated superiority of the 0.03 mg estriol\\u2013lactobacilli combination to placebo (p \\u003c 0.001).

Because of the chronic nature of the disease, self-care is necessary. Education alone is not effective in providing care. Misunderstanding by the patients regarding diabetes during the training programs render telephone follow-up after training essential.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:: This quasi-experimental study with two groups (experimental and control) was conducted in two phases in 2014. The study population consisted of 70 children of 10–18 years of age with type I diabetes (35 patients in the experimental group and 35 in the control group). The participants were randomly selected from the patients referring to the Sedigheh Tahereh Diabetic Research and Treatment Center in Isfahan, Iran. Data were collected using a researcher-made questionnaire on self-care and a glycosylated hemoglobin recording form. The experimental group received 12 weeks of telephone follow-up training by the center, whereas the control group received no follow-up.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: The results showed that, after intervention, the total mean score of self-care in all aspects of diabetes care for children was significantly higher in the experimental group (p < 0.001). In addition, a statistically significant difference was observed between the experimental and control groups in terms of mean glycosylated hemoglobin after the intervention (p = 0.030).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:: It can be concluded that telephone follow-up by a nurse can improve total self-care and glycosylated hemoglobin in patients with type I diabetes.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"12 weeks of telephone follow-up training by the center\", \"no follow-up\", \"the mean score of self-care\", \"significantly increased\", \"after intervention, the total mean score of self-care in all aspects of diabetes care for children was significantly higher in the experimental group (p \\u003c 0.001)\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Completion rate was 71% (n = 71) in the intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) group and 85% (n = 33) among waiting list controls. Compared to controls body weight (−17.0 (95% CI: −18.7, −15.3) kg, P < 0.0001), fat mass (−15.2 (95% CI: −17.4, −13.1) kg, P < 0.0001), fat free mass (−1.2 (95% CI: −2.2, −0.2) kg, P = 0.016) and visceral fat (−86.6(95% CI: −97.4, −75.7) cm2, P < 0.0001) were reduced in the ILI-group after 10–14 weeks. Within the ILI-group weight loss was −23.8 (95% CI: −25.9, −21.7) kg, P < 0.0001 and -20.3 (95% CI: −23.3, −17.3) kg, P < 0.0001, after six and 12 months, respectively. Systolic BP, glucose, triglycerides, and LDL-C were reduced, and HDL-C was increased (all P ≤ 0.006) after 10–14 weeks within the ILI group. The reduction in glucose and increase in HDL-C were sustained after 12 months (all P < 0.0001). After one year, weight loss was related to increased cognitive restraint and decreased uncontrolled eating (all P < 0.05). Thus, ILI including high volume of PA resulted in weight loss with almost maintenance of fat-free mass, favorable changes in CVD risk factors, and eating behavior in subjects with severe obesity.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"Intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) group\", \"Waiting list control\", \"Body weight\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Compared to controls body weight (\\u221217.0 (95% CI: \\u221218.7, \\u221215.3) kg, P \\u003c 0.0001), fat mass (\\u221215.2 (95% CI: \\u221217.4, \\u221213.1) kg, P \\u003c 0.0001), fat free mass (\\u22121.2 (95% CI: \\u22122.2, \\u22120.2) kg, P = 0.016) and visceral fat (\\u221286.6(95% CI: \\u221297.4, \\u221275.7) cm2, P \\u003c 0.0001) were reduced in the ILI-group after 10\\u201314 weeks.\"], [\"Intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) group\", \"Waiting list control\", \"Fat mass\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Compared to controls body weight (\\u221217.0 (95% CI: \\u221218.7, \\u221215.3) kg, P \\u003c 0.0001), fat mass (\\u221215.2 (95% CI: \\u221217.4, \\u221213.1) kg, P \\u003c 0.0001), fat free mass (\\u22121.2 (95% CI: \\u22122.2, \\u22120.2) kg, P = 0.016) and visceral fat (\\u221286.6(95% CI: \\u221297.4, \\u221275.7) cm2, P \\u003c 0.0001) were reduced in the ILI-group after 10\\u201314 weeks.\"], [\"Intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) group\", \"Waiting list control\", \"Fat mass\", \"significantly decreased\", \".

An individual session was further conducted biannually during the 3 years. Participants in the UCG received usual care such as one group session on healthy lifestyles.\n\nABSTRACT.OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary endpoint was the development of T2DM based on an oral glucose tolerance test.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 2.3 years. The annual incidence of T2DM were 2.7 and 5.1/100 person-years of follow-up in the ILG (n=145) and UCG (n=149), respectively. The cumulative incidence of T2DM was significantly lower in the ILG than in the UCG among participants with HbA1c levels ≥5.7% (log-rank=3.52, p=0.06; Breslow=4.05, p=0.04; Tarone-Ware=3.79, p=0.05), while this was not found among participants with HbA1c levels <5.7%.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Intensive lifestyle intervention in primary healthcare setting is effective in preventing the development of T2DM in IGT participants with HbA1c levels ≥5.7%, relative to those with HbA1c levels <5.7%.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: UMIN000003136.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"intensive lifestyle intervention group (ILG)\", \"usual care group (UCG)\", \"cumulative incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among participants with baseline HbA1c levels \\u22655.7%\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The cumulative incidence of T2DM was significantly lower in the ILG than in the UCG among participants with HbA1c levels \\u22655.7% (log-rank=3.52, p=0.06; Breslow=4.05, p=0.04; Tarone-Ware=3.79, p=0.05), while this was not found among participants with HbA1c levels \\u003c5.7%.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Completion rate was 71% (n = 71) in the intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) group and 85% (n = 33) among waiting list controls. Compared to controls body weight (−17.0 (95% CI: −18.7, −15.3) kg, P < 0.0001), fat mass (−15.2 (95% CI: −17.4, −13.1) kg, P < 0.0001), fat free mass (−1.2 (95% CI: −2.2, −0.2) kg, P = 0.016) and visceral fat (−86.6(95% CI: −97.4, −75.7) cm2, P < 0.0001) were reduced in the ILI-group after 10–14 weeks. Within the ILI-group weight loss was −23.8 (95% CI: −25.9, −21.7) kg, P < 0.0001 and -20.3 (95% CI: −23.3, −17.3) kg, P < 0.0001, after six and 12 months, respectively. Systolic BP, glucose, triglycerides, and LDL-C were reduced, and HDL-C was increased (all P ≤ 0.006) after 10–14 weeks within the ILI group. The reduction in glucose and increase in HDL-C were sustained after 12 months (all P < 0.0001). After one year, weight loss was related to increased cognitive restraint and decreased uncontrolled eating (all P < 0.05). Thus, ILI including high volume of PA resulted in weight loss with almost maintenance of fat-free mass, favorable changes in CVD risk factors, and eating behavior in subjects with severe obesity.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) group\", \"waiting list controls\", \"body weight\", \"significantly decreased\", \"body weight (−17.0 (95% CI: −18.7, −15.3) kg, P < 0.0001) was reduced in the ILI-group after 10–14 weeks.\"],\n    [\"intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) group\", \"waiting list controls\", \"fat mass\", \"significantly decreased\", \"fat mass (−15.2 (95% CI: −17.4, −13.1) kg, P < 0.0001) was reduced in the ILI-group after 10–14 weeks.\"],\n    [\"intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) group\", \"waiting list controls\", \"fat free mass\", \"significantly decreased\", \"fat free mass (−1.2 (95% CI: −2.2, −0.2) kg, P = 0.016) was reduced in the ILI-group after 10–14 weeks.\"],\n    [\"intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) group\", \"waiting list controls\", \"visceral fat\", \"significantly decreased\", \"visceral fat (−86.6(95% CI: −97.4, −75.7) cm2, P < 0.0001) was reduced in the ILI-group after 10–14 weeks.\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) group\", \"waiting list controls\", \"body weight\", \"significantly decreased\", \"body weight (−17.0 (95% CI: −18.7, −15.3) kg, P < 0.0001) was reduced in the ILI-group after 10–14 weeks.\"],\n    [\"intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) group\", \"waiting list controls\", \"fat mass\", \"significantly decreased\", \"fat mass (−15.2 (95% CI: −17.4, −13.1) kg, P < 0.0001) was reduced in the ILI-group after 10–14 weeks.\"],\n    [\"intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) group\", \"waiting list controls\", \"fat free mass\", \"significantly decreased\", \"fat free mass (−1.2 (95% CI: −2.2, −0.2) kg, P = 0.016) was reduced in the ILI-group after 10–14 weeks.\"],\n    [\"intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) group\", \"waiting list controls\", \"visceral fat\", \"significantly decreased\", \"visceral fat (−86.6(95% CI: −97.4, −75.7) cm2, P < 0.0001) was reduced in the ILI-group after 10–14 weeks.\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "2cc3bde276488ebfec12ca4f80ddd63f4932e167ef6ac848925f9206c484dfc0", "prompt_hash": "cef49c89cf676f6194681549d7a890950473344b27c37eea96767f854b228e85", "target_hash": "99f4297c14e4a10e69f0b41de52c8c1142ff4192a19ef543c3b22bbc65acc9f1", "bypass": null}

A conclusion is yet to be reached on the role of crystalloids and colloids in immediate fluid therapy. This study was done to determine the suitable solution in immediate resuscitation of patients with hemorrhagic shock caused by tissue trauma.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: One hundred trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock, who underwent fluid therapy in the emergency unit, were assigned randomly to two groups of hydroxyethyl starch (Voluven) and normal saline. Before and after fluid therapy, 1 cc of blood was taken from all patients in order to determine and compare base excess levels.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: In hydroxyethyl starch (Voluven) and normal saline groups, base excess level after solution therapy increased about 9.65 and 5.46 volumes, respectively, in which augmentation in hydroxyethyl starch (Voluven) group is significantly higher than normal saline group (P ≤ 0.001).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: By using hydroxyethyl starch (Voluven) for fluid therapy in hemorrhagic shock caused by trauma, serum base excess decreases and results in improvement in tissue perfusion and better balance in acid-base status and it seems to be superior over normal saline administration, but the building block of the ideal fluid therapy should still remain with the physician's final clinical judgment.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Hydroxyethyl starch (Voluven)\", \"Normal saline\", \"Level of base excess after therapy\", \"significantly increased\", \"In hydroxyethyl starch (Voluven) and normal saline groups, base excess level after solution therapy increased about 9.65 and 5.46 volumes, respectively, in which augmentation in hydroxyethyl starch (Voluven) group is significantly higher than normal saline group (P \\u2264 0.001).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

A total of 120 consecutive patients were allocated alternately to the two study groups: perioperative immunomodulation with IL-2 (IL-2 group; n=60) and perioperative immunomonitoring without immunomodulation (control group; n=60). Patients from the IL-2 group received four doses of 10 × 106 IU m−2 twice daily subcutaneously a week before operation followed by a daily maintenance dose of 3 × 106 IU m−2 subcutaneously until a day before the operation. Parameters of cellular and humoral immunity (leucocytes, T-cell markers CD3, CD4, and CD8, B-cell marker CD19, monocyte marker CD14, natural killer (NK) cell markers CD16, CD56, and CD57, activation markers CD6, CD25, CD28, and CD69, progenitor cell marker CD34, as well as IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, soluble IL-2 receptor, IL-1 receptor antagonist, transforming growth factor-β1, and vascular endothelial growth factor) were measured in peripheral venous blood at various intervals. Interleukin-2-related toxicity was WHO grade 1 (24%), 2 (67%), and 3 (9%). In the postoperative period, T-cell markers, activation markers, and NK cell markers decreased, and IL-6 and IL-10 increased. However, all these alterations were significantly less accentuated in patients who had been pretreated with IL-2. Median follow-up was 40 months.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the effect of religious programs based on Islam on spiritual wellbeing in elderly patients with hypertension who referred to the health centers of Isfahan in 2014.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:: This study was a randomized clinical trial. The participants (52 elderly patients with hypertension) were randomly divided in to experimental and control groups. Religious program was implemented for the experimental group in eight sessions in two Isfahan health centers. Spirituality wellbeing survey (SWB) questionnaire was completed in three steps, namely, pretest, posttest and follow-up (1 month) in two groups. In the study, Chi-square test, independent t-test, and repeated-measures analysis of variance were performed for analyzing the data.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: Before the intervention, there was no significant difference between the mean scores of spiritual wellbeing, the religious dimension, and the existential aspect of spiritual wellbeing of the two groups. However in the posttest step and follow-up stage, the mean scores of spiritual wellbeing, the religious dimension, and the existential aspect of spiritual wellbeing in the experimental group was significantly higher than in the control group (P < 0.001).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:: The religious program based on Islam promoted the SWB of elderly patients with hypertension; further, nurses can use these programs to promote the SWB of elderly patients with hypertension.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"religious programs based on Islam\", \"no intervention\", \"spiritual wellbeing\", \"significantly increased\", \"the mean scores of spiritual wellbeing in the experimental group was significantly higher than in the control group (P < 0.001).\"],\n    [\"religious programs based on Islam\", \"no intervention\", \"religious dimension of spiritual wellbeing\", \"significantly increased\", \"the mean scores of the religious dimension of spiritual wellbeing in the experimental group was significantly higher than in the control group (P < 0.001).\"],\n    [\"religious programs based on Islam\", \"no intervention\", \"existential aspect of spiritual wellbeing\", \"significantly increased\", \"the mean scores of the existential aspect of spiritual wellbeing in the experimental group was significantly higher than in the control group (P < 0.001).\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"religious programs based on Islam\", \"no intervention\", \"spiritual wellbeing\", \"significantly increased\", \"the mean scores of spiritual wellbeing in the experimental group was significantly higher than in the control group (P < 0.001).\"],\n    [\"religious programs based on Islam\", \"no intervention\", \"religious dimension of spiritual wellbeing\", \"significantly increased\", \"the mean scores of the religious dimension of spiritual wellbeing in the experimental group was significantly higher than in the control group (P < 0.001).\"],\n    [\"religious programs based on Islam\", \"no intervention\", \"existential aspect of spiritual wellbeing\", \"significantly increased\", \"the mean scores of the existential aspect of spiritual wellbeing in the experimental group was significantly higher than in the control group (P < 0.001).\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "70b385dd7861dc967f0107467abee2ac881d242bc8594627bc2248f33d8f0a1c", "prompt_hash": "76d46ab42718aa6bbb87800c5196dc345a755a57ae0614fe137d3b63b42c13a5", "target_hash": "3a04655efc574d367a7b0b60cee1830d79d4d1716aa8e306870150190b955418", "bypass": null}

Promising results of calcitriol supplementation in studies aiming space flight induced osteoporosis is little and the effect of this hormone on biomarkers of bone metabolism is not examined yet in space flight models of osteoporosis in rats.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: This was an interventional animal study being performed in a 1-month period. We included 21 Sprague Dawley strain rats (>200 gr, >6 week) who were randomly assigned to receive daily supplementation of oral 0.03μgr calcitriol and to be submitted to tail suspension model. Rats were followed for 1 month and were tested for serum osteocalcin (OC), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and serum calcium at the beginning and the end of the study period. The results were analyzed and compared between groups.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Although serum levels of osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase biomarkers and total serum calcium were not significantly different within and between study groups, their levels were increased in tail suspension model compared to control group. The levels of these biomarkers were lower in those who were submitted to tail suspension model and received calcitriol supplementation compared to those who were only submitted to tail suspension (60.14 ± 11.73 ng/mL vs. 58.29 ± 2.69 ng/mL; p = 0.696 for osteocalcin and 381.86 ± 99.16 mU/mL vs. 362.57 ± 27.41 ng/mL; p = 0.635 for alkaline phosphatase).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Supplementation of daily diet with calcitriol in rats under weightlessness conditions may results in lower values for bone metabolic biomarkers of alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin and serum calcium. This pattern of change in biomarkers of bone formation, may point to the capacity of calcitriol supplementation in preventing cellular process of osteoporosis.

Fresh Scoparia dulcis porridge elicited a low glycaemic index (GI) and anti-hyperglycaemic effects when fed to diabetic Wistar rats. Commercially produced Scoparia dulcis porridge (SDC) elicited medium GI. Present study was aimed at studying the anti-diabetic effects of consumption of commercially produced S. dulcis porridge.\n\nABSTRACT.METHOD: A randomized crossover clinical trial with type 2 diabetic patients (n = 35) on medication, with mild and moderate diabetes [fasting blood glucose (FBG) 126–300 mg/dL, age 35–70 years] was conducted. Within the first three months (study period 1) group 1 was the test and group 2 was the control. Following a wash-out period, the two groups were crossed over (study period 2: group 1 – control; group 2 - test). Test group consumed commercially produced SDC for 3 days/week for three months and the control group any other food. At the onset and end of each study period glucose measurements [Fasting Blood Glucose (FBG), HbA1c], lipid measurements (total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides, cholesterol ratios), toxicity parameters (liver enzymes, creatinine, CRP, eGFR) were analyzed by enzyme assay kit methods using a KONELAB 20XT auto analyzer. Significances between groups were analyzed by one way ANOVA (normal distribution) and Mann Whitney test (if the values were not normally distributed). Within group comparisons were carried out by Bonferroni post hoc test.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: During the crossover clinical trial HbA1c of group 1 decreased from 7.9 ± 0.5 to 6.5 ± 0.3 (p = 0.003) while HbA1c of group 2 decreased from 7.0 ± 0.3to 6.7 ± 0.3 while in the test group. Therefore, both test groups (1 and 2) elicited a decrease in HbA1c compared to respective control groups. Both test groups elicited a non significant decrease in FBG following the intervention (group 1 - from 174 ± 14 to 160 ± 10 mg/dL; group 2 - from 183 ± 13 to 160 ± 7 mg/dL). No significant differences (p >0.05) in insulin, cholesterol measurements (total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides and cholesterol ratios) and atherogenic index between or within groups were observed. All other measurements (AST, ALT, ALP, creatinine, CRP, eGFR) were normal and not significantly different between or within groups.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Porridge made with SDC leaf extract decreased FBG and HbA1c (p >0.05) of type 2 diabetic patients. The porridge had no effect on cholesterol measurements and no toxicity was observed at the dose tested. Therefore, the SDC porridge can be recommended as a suitable meal for diabetic patients.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Commercially produced Scoparia dulcis porridge (SDC)\", \"Any other food\", \"Liver enzymes\", \"no significant difference\", \"All other measurements (AST, ALT, ALP, creatinine, CRP, eGFR) were normal and not significantly different between or within groups.\"], [\"Commercially produced Scoparia dulcis porridge (SDC)\", \"Any other food\", \"Atherogenic index\", \"no significant difference\", \"No significant differences (p \\u003e0.05) in insulin, cholesterol measurements (total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides and cholesterol ratios) and atherogenic index between or within groups were observed.\"], [\"Commercially produced Scoparia dulcis porridge (SDC)\", \"Any other food\", \"Fasting blood glucose\", \"no significant difference\", \"Both test groups elicited a non significant decrease in FBG following the intervention (group 1 - from 174 \\u00b1 14 to 160 \\u00b1 10 mg/dL; group 2 - from 183 \\u00b1 13 to 160 \\u00b1 7 mg/dL).\"], [\"Commercially produced Scoparia dulcis porridge (SDC)\", \"Any other food\", \"HbA1c levels\", \"significantly decreased\", \"both test groups (1 and 2) elicited a decrease in HbA1c compared to respective control groups.\"], [\"Commercially produced Scoparia dulcis porridge (SDC)\", \"Any other food\", \"Insulin and cholesterol levels\", \"no significant difference\", \"No significant differences (p \\u003e0.05) in insulin, cholesterol measurements (total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides and cholesterol ratios) and atherogenic index between or within groups were observed.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

This study aims to determine the cost-effectiveness of the COACH program in comparison with usual care from a societal perspective.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: A controlled clinical trial was performed at the Internal Medicine department of a general teaching hospital. All admitted patients using at least one prescription drug were included. The COACH program consisted of medication reconciliation, patient counselling at discharge, and communication to healthcare providers in primary care. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with an unplanned rehospitalisation within three months after discharge. Also, the number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was assessed.

The primary efficacy endpoint was median percent reduction from baseline in monthly (28-day) seizure frequency for the 16-week double-blind treatment period in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population with analyzable seizure data. Other efficacy analyses included proportion of patients with ≥ 50% seizure reduction, proportion of patients seizure free, and the relationship between clinical response and plasma concentration.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Median percent reduction was -28.7% for placebo, −38.2% (P = 0.08 vs placebo) for once-daily SPN-804 1200 mg, and −42.9% (P = 0.003) for SPN-804 2400 mg. Responder rates were 28.1%, 36.1% (P = 0.08), and 40.7% (P = 0.02); 16-week seizure-free rates in a pragmatic ITT analysis were 3.3%, 4.9% (P = 0.59), and 11.4% (P = 0.008), respectively. When data were analyzed separately for study site clusters, a post hoc analysis demonstrated that both SPN-804 dosages were significantly superior to placebo in median percent seizure reduction (placebo: −13.3%; 1200 mg: −34.5%, P = 0.02; 2400 mg: −52.7%, P = 0.006) in the North American study site cluster. A concentration–response analysis also supported a clinically meaningful effect for 1200 mg. Adverse event types reflected the drug's established profile. Adverse event frequency was consistent with a pharmacokinetic profile in which SPN-804 produces lower peak plasma concentrations vs immediate-release OXC. Once-daily dosing was not associated with any new safety signals.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive once-daily SPN-804 improved seizure control in patients with inadequately controlled partial-onset seizures. Adverse event occurrence and discontinuations due to adverse events suggest improved tolerability vs previously published data with immediate-release OXC.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"Extended-release oxcarbazepine 2400 mg\", \"Control\", \"Overall seizure median percent improvement \", \"significantly increased\", \"Median percent reduction was -28.7% for placebo, \\u221238.2% (P = 0.08 vs placebo) for once-daily SPN-804 1200 mg, and \\u221242.9% (P = 0.003) for SPN-804 2400 mg\"], [\"Extended-release oxcarbazepine 2400 mg\", \"Control\", \"Overall seizure median percent improvement \", \"significantly increased\", \"When data were analyzed separately for study site clusters, a post hoc analysis demonstrated that both SPN-804 dosages were significantly superior to placebo in median percent seizure reduction (placebo: \\u221213.3%; 1200 mg: \\u221234.5%, P = 0.02; 2400 mg: \\u221252.7%, P = 0.006) in the North American study site cluster.\"], [\"Extended-release oxcarbazepine 1200 mg\", \"Control\", \"Overall seizure median percent reduction\", \"no significant difference\", \"Median percent reduction was -28.7% for placebo, \\u221238.2% (P = 0.08 vs placebo) for once-daily SPN-804 1200 mg, and \\u221242.9% (P = 0.003) for SPN-804 2400 mg\"], [\"Extended-release oxcarbazepine 1200 mg\", \"Control\", \"Seizure median percent improvement in North America\", \"significantly increased\", \"both SPN-804 dosages were significantly superior to placebo in median percent seizure reduction (placebo: \\u221213.3%; 1200 mg: \\u221234.5%, P = 0.02; 2400 mg: \\u221252.7%, P = 0.006)\"], [\"Extended-release oxcarbazepine 2400 mg\", \"Control\", \"Seizure median percent improvement in North America\", \"significantly increased\", \"both SPN-804 dosages were significantly superior to placebo in median percent seizure reduction (placebo: \\u221213.3%; 1200 mg: \\u221234.5%, P = 0.02; 2400 mg: \\u221252.7%, P = 0.006) in the North American study site cluster\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:109"}, "target": "[[\"Extended-release oxcarbazepine 2400 mg\", \"Control\", \"Overall seizure median percent improvement \", \"significantly increased\", \"Median percent reduction was -28.7% for placebo, \\u221238.2% (P = 0.08 vs placebo) for once-daily SPN-804 1200 mg, and \\u221242.9% (P = 0.003) for SPN-804 2400 mg\"], [\"Extended-release oxcarbazepine 2400 mg\", \"Control\", \"Overall seizure median percent improvement \", \"significantly increased\", \"When data were analyzed separately for study site clusters, a post hoc analysis demonstrated that both SPN-804 dosages were significantly superior to placebo in median percent seizure reduction (placebo: \\u221213.3%; 1200 mg: \\u221234.5%, P = 0.02; 2400 mg: \\u221252.7%, P = 0.006) in the North American study site cluster.\"], [\"Extended-release oxcarbazepine 1200 mg\", \"Control\", \"Overall seizure median percent reduction\", \"no significant difference\", \"Median percent reduction was -28.7% for placebo, \\u221238.2% (P = 0.08 vs placebo) for once-daily SPN-804 1200 mg, and \\u221242.9% (P = 0.003) for SPN-804 2400 mg\"], [\"Extended-release oxcarbazepine 1200 mg\", \"Control\", \"Seizure median percent improvement in North America\", \"significantly increased\", \"both SPN-804 dosages were significantly superior to placebo in median percent seizure reduction (placebo: \\u221213.3%; 1200 mg: \\u221234.5%, P = 0.02; 2400 mg: \\u221252.7%, P = 0.006)\"], [\"Extended-release oxcarbazepine 2400 mg\", \"Control\", \"Seizure median percent improvement in North America\", \"significantly increased\", \"both SPN-804 dosages were significantly superior to placebo in median percent seizure reduction (placebo: \\u221213.3%; 1200 mg: \\u221234.5%, P = 0.02; 2400 mg: \\u221252.7%, P = 0.006) in the North American study site cluster\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

This was followed by an exploratory 21-day study in which TAU participants received OLPs while OLP participants in the main study were followed after discontinuing placebos. Cancer survivors (N = 74) who completed cancer treatment 6 months to 10 years prior to enrollment reporting at least moderate fatigue (i.e., ≥4 on a 0–10 scale) were randomized to OLP or TAU. Those randomized to OLP took 2 placebo pills twice a day for 21 days. Compared to those randomized to TAU, OLP participants reported a 29% improvement in fatigue severity (average difference in the mean change scores (MD) 12.47, 95% CI 3.32, 21.61; P = 0.008), medium effect (d = 0.63), and a 39% improvement in fatigue-disrupted quality of life (MD = 11.76, 95% CI 4.65, 18.86; P = 0.002), a large effect (d = 0.76). TAU participants who elected to try OLP for 21-days after the main study reported reductions in fatigue of a similar magnitude for fatigue severity and fatigue-disrupted quality of life (23% and 35%, respectively).

The optimal framework to categorize clinical trials according to risk remains unclear, however. Switzerland is the first European country to adopt a risk-based categorization procedure in January 2014. We assessed how accurately and consistently clinical trials are categorized using two different approaches: an approach using criteria set forth in the new law (concept) or an intuitive approach (ad hoc).\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS:: This was a randomized controlled trial with a method-comparison study nested in each arm. We used clinical trial protocols from eight Swiss ethics committees approved between 2010 and 2011. Protocols were randomly assigned to be categorized in one of three risk categories using the concept or the ad hoc approach. Each protocol was independently categorized by the trial's sponsor, a group of experts and the approving ethics committee. The primary outcome was the difference in categorization agreement between the expert group and sponsors across arms. Linear weighted kappa was used to quantify agreements, with the difference between kappas being the primary effect measure.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: We included 142 of 231 protocols in the final analysis (concept = 78; ad hoc = 64). Raw agreement between the expert group and sponsors was 0.74 in the concept and 0.78 in the ad hoc arm. Chance-corrected agreement was higher in the ad hoc (kappa: 0.34 (95% confidence interval = 0.10–0.58)) than in the concept arm (0.27 (0.06–0.50)), but the difference was not significant (p = 0.67).\n\nABSTRACT.LIMITATIONS:: The main limitation was the large number of protocols excluded from the analysis mostly because they did not fit with the clinical trial definition of the new law.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: A structured risk categorization approach was not better than an ad hoc approach. Laws introducing risk-based approaches should provide guidelines, examples and templates to ensure correct application.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"New law criteria (Concept)\", \"Intuitive approach (ad hoc)\", \"Agreement between Experts and Sponsors\", \"no significant difference\", \"Raw agreement between the expert group and sponsors was 0.74 in the concept and 0.78 in the ad hoc arm.

Secondary outcomes were quality of life (SF-36), weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, concentrations of fasting serum lipids, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), glucose, insulin, and physical fitness. <p> Results Mean age was 58.9 (SD 7) years. Trial retention rates were 93% and 89% at 12 and 24 months, respectively. At baseline, 10% of intervention participants and 11% of control participants were achieving 150 minutes of at least moderate intensity physical activity a week. At 12 months rates increased to 43% and 30% and at 24 months to 39.3% and 32.8% (P<0.001), respectively. SF-36 physical functioning (P=0.03) and mental health (P<0.05) scores improved more in intervention compared with control participants, but role physical scores were significantly lower (P<0.01). There were no significant differences in clinical outcomes. More falls (P<0.001) and injuries (P=0.03) were recorded in the intervention group. <p> Conclusions This programme of exercise on prescription increased physical activity and quality of life over two years, although falls and injuries also increased.

Secondary outcomes were quality of life (SF-36), weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, concentrations of fasting serum lipids, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), glucose, insulin, and physical fitness. <p> Results Mean age was 58.9 (SD 7) years. Trial retention rates were 93% and 89% at 12 and 24 months, respectively. At baseline, 10% of intervention participants and 11% of control participants were achieving 150 minutes of at least moderate intensity physical activity a week. At 12 months rates increased to 43% and 30% and at 24 months to 39.3% and 32.8% (P<0.001), respectively. SF-36 physical functioning (P=0.03) and mental health (P<0.05) scores improved more in intervention compared with control participants, but role physical scores were significantly lower (P<0.01). There were no significant differences in clinical outcomes. More falls (P<0.001) and injuries (P=0.03) were recorded in the intervention group. <p> Conclusions This programme of exercise on prescription increased physical activity and quality of life over two years, although falls and injuries also increased. This finding supports the use of exercise on prescription programmes as part of population strategies to reduce physical inactivity. <p> Trial registration Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) ANZCTRN012605000490673.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"Brief physical activity intervention\", \"Control\", \"Physical activity\", \"significantly increased\", \"At 12 months rates increased to 43% and 30% and at 24 months to 39.3% and 32.8% (P<0.001), respectively.\"],\n    [\"Brief physical activity intervention\", \"Control\", \"SF-36 physical functioning\", \"significantly increased\", \"SF-36 physical functioning (P=0.03) scores improved more in intervention compared with control participants.\"],\n    [\"Brief physical activity intervention\", \"Control\", \"SF-36 mental health\", \"significantly increased\", \"SF-36 mental health (P<0.05) scores improved more in intervention compared with control participants.\"],\n    [\"Brief physical activity intervention\", \"Control\", \"Role physical scores\", \"significantly decreased\", \"but role physical scores were significantly lower (P<0.01).\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"Brief physical activity intervention\", \"Control\", \"Physical activity\", \"significantly increased\", \"At 12 months rates increased to 43% and 30% and at 24 months to 39.3% and 32.8% (P<0.001), respectively.\"],\n    [\"Brief physical activity intervention\", \"Control\", \"SF-36 physical functioning\", \"significantly increased\", \"SF-36 physical functioning (P=0.03) scores improved more in intervention compared with control participants.\"],\n    [\"Brief physical activity intervention\", \"Control\", \"SF-36 mental health\", \"significantly increased\", \"SF-36 mental health (P<0.05) scores improved more in intervention compared with control participants.\"],\n    [\"Brief physical activity intervention\", \"Control\", \"Role physical scores\", \"significantly decreased\", \"but role physical scores were significantly lower (P<0.01).\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "7db5d39af5ca4a3229682147c4fd75f4a167ad9fab4e65da7ab7f1f73ea7a0f8", "prompt_hash": "b9ed01b055d6f814bc8561907bd287efc28b90e1215ff0b72001ee7e7cf9e175", "target_hash": "de5f028952083e4d364d13fa74b5ef99c7420cac6b093614f03317bd661d8696", "bypass": null}

We aimed to investigate if intake of orange juice with or in-between meals differently affects energy balance or metabolic risk. Twenty-six healthy adults (24.7 ± 3.2 y; BMI 23.2 ± 3.2 kg/m2) participated in a 4-week cross-over intervention and consumed orange juice (20% of energy requirement) either together with 3 meals/d (WM) or in-between 3 meals/d (BM) at ad libitum energy intake. Basal and postprandial insulin sensitivity (primary outcome), daylong glycaemia, glucose variability and insulin secretion were assessed. Body fat mass was measured by air-displacement plethysmography. After BM-intervention, fat mass increased (+1.0 ± 1.8 kg; p < 0.05) and postprandial insulin sensitivity tended to decrease (ΔMatsudaISI: −0.89 ± 2.3; p = 0.06). By contrast, after WM-intervention fat mass and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) decreased (−0.30 ± 0.65 kg; −2.50 ± 3.94; both p < 0.05), whereas glucose variability was higher (ΔMAGE: +0.45 ± 0.59, p < 0.05). Daylong glycaemia, insulin secretion, changes in basal insulin sensitivity, and triglycerides did not differ between WM- and BM-interventions (all p > 0.05). In young healthy adults, a conventional 3-meal structure with orange juice consumed together with meals had a favorable impact on energy balance, whereas juice consumption in-between meals may contribute to a gain in body fat and adverse metabolic effects.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Orange juice intake in-between meals (BM)\", \"Orange juice intake with each meal (WM) \", \"Insulin sensitivity after meals\", \"no significant difference\", \"fter BM-intervention, fat mass increased (+1.0 \\u00b1 1.8 kg; p \\u003c 0.05) and postprandial insulin sensitivity tended to decrease (\\u0394MatsudaISI: \\u22120.89 \\u00b1 2.3; p = 0.06). \"], [\"Orange juice intake in-between meals (BM)\", \"Orange juice intake with each meal (WM) \", \"Insulin sensitivity after meals\", \"no significant difference\", \"aylong glycaemia, insulin secretion, changes in basal insulin sensitivity, and triglycerides did not differ between WM- and BM-interventions (all p \\u003e 0.05). \"], [\"Orange juice intake in-between meals (BM)\", \"Orange juice intake with each meal (WM) \", \"Basal insulin sensitivity\", \"no significant difference\", \"Daylong glycaemia, insulin secretion, changes in basal insulin sensitivity, and triglycerides did not differ between WM- and BM-interventions (all p \\u003e 0.05).\"], [\"Orange juice intake in-between meals (BM)\", \"Orange juice intake with each meal (WM) \", \"Secretion of insulin\", \"no significant difference\", \"Daylong glycaemia, insulin secretion, changes in basal insulin sensitivity, and triglycerides did not differ between WM- and BM-interventions (all p \\u003e 0.05).\"], [\"Orange juice intake in-between meals (BM)\", \"Orange juice intake with each meal (WM) \", \"Triglycerides levels\", \"no significant difference\", \"Daylong glycaemia, insulin secretion, changes in basal insulin sensitivity, and triglycerides did not differ between WM- and BM-interventions (all p \\u003e 0.05).\"], [\"Orange juice intake in-between meals (BM)\", \"Orange juice intake with each meal (WM) \", \"Daylong glycemia\", \"no significant difference\", \"Daylong glycaemia, insulin secretion, changes in basal insulin sensitivity, and triglycerides did not differ between WM- and BM-interventions (all p \\u003e 0.05).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

The order of the two interventions was random; each period lasted 4 weeks in adults and 3 weeks in adolescents. The primary outcome was time during which sensor glucose readings were in the target range of 3.9–8.0 mmol/l.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The proportion of time when sensor glucose was in the target range (3.9–8.0 mmol/l) overnight (between 24:00 and 08:00 hours) was 18.5% greater during closed‐loop insulin delivery than during sensor‐augmented therapy (p < 0.001). Closed‐loop therapy significantly reduced mean overnight glucose levels by 0.9 mmol/l (p < 0.001), with no difference in glycaemic variability, as measured by the standard deviation of sensor glucose. Time spent above the target range was reduced (p = 0.001), as was time spent in hypoglycaemia (<3.9 mmol/l; p = 0.014) during closed‐loop therapy. Lower mean overnight glucose levels during closed‐loop therapy were brought about by increased overnight insulin delivery (p < 0.001) without changes to the total daily delivery (p = 0.84).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Overnight closed‐loop insulin therapy at home in adults and adolescents with type 1 diabetes is feasible, showing improvements in glucose control and reducing the risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"Closed\\u2010loop insulin\", \"Control\", \"Time at target range\", \"significantly increased\", \"The proportion of time when sensor glucose was in the target range (3.9\\u20138.0 mmol/l) overnight (between 24:00 and 08:00 hours) was 18.5% greater during closed\\u2010loop insulin delivery than during sensor\\u2010augmented therapy (p \\u003c 0.001).\"], [\"Closed\\u2010loop insulin\", \"Control\", \"Mean overnight sensor glucose\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Closed\\u2010loop therapy significantly reduced mean overnight glucose levels by 0.9 mmol/l (p \\u003c 0.001), with no difference in glycaemic variability, as measured by the standard deviation of sensor glucose.\"], [\"Closed\\u2010loop insulin\", \"Control\", \"Sensor hypoglycaemia \", \"significantly decreased\", \"Closed\\u2010loop therapy significantly reduced mean overnight glucose levels by 0.9 mmol/l (p \\u003c 0.001), with no difference in glycaemic variability, as measured by the standard deviation of sensor glucose.\"], [\"Closed\\u2010loop insulin\", \"Control\", \"Overnight insulin delivered \", \"significantly increased\", \"Lower mean overnight glucose levels during closed\\u2010loop therapy were brought about by increased overnight insulin delivery (p \\u003c 0.001) without changes to the total daily delivery (p = 0.84).\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:112"}, "target": "[[\"Closed\\u2010loop insulin\", \"Control\", \"Time at target range\", \"significantly increased\", \"The proportion of time when sensor glucose was in the target range (3.9\\u20138.0 mmol/l) overnight (between 24:00 and 08:00 hours) was 18.5% greater during closed\\u2010loop insulin delivery than during sensor\\u2010augmented therapy (p \\u003c 0.001).\"], [\"Closed\\u2010loop insulin\", \"Control\", \"Mean overnight sensor glucose\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Closed\\u2010loop therapy significantly reduced mean overnight glucose levels by 0.9 mmol/l (p \\u003c 0.001), with no difference in glycaemic variability, as measured by the standard deviation of sensor glucose.\"], [\"Closed\\u2010loop insulin\", \"Control\", \"Sensor hypoglycaemia \", \"significantly decreased\", \"Closed\\u2010loop therapy significantly reduced mean overnight glucose levels by 0.9 mmol/l (p \\u003c 0.001), with no difference in glycaemic variability, as measured by the standard deviation of sensor glucose.\"], [\"Closed\\u2010loop insulin\", \"Control\", \"Overnight insulin delivered \", \"significantly increased\", \"Lower mean overnight glucose levels during closed\\u2010loop therapy were brought about by increased overnight insulin delivery (p \\u003c 0.001) without changes to the total daily delivery (p = 0.84).\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

Additionally, the in-patient medical costs of both treatment arms were compared. 40 patients with solid tumours were randomized to receive HD-VIC chemotherapy with or without amifostine (910 mg/m2 at day 1–3) given as a short infusion prior to carboplatin and ifosfamide. Patients were stratified according to pretreatment. HDCT consisted of an 18 h infusion of carboplatin (500 mg/m2/d over 18 h), ifosfamide (4 g/m2/d over 4 h) and etoposide (500 mg/m2/d) all given for 3 consecutive days. All patients received prophylactic application of G-CSF (5 μg kg−1 subcutaneously) to ameliorate neutropenia after treatment. Patients were monitored for nephrotoxicity, gastrointestinal side effects, haematopoietic recovery, as well as frequency of fever and infections. The median fall of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 10% from baseline in the amifostine group (105 to 95 ml min−1) and 37% in the control patient group (107 to 67 ml min−1) (P< 0.01). Amifostine-treated patients revealed a less pronounced increase in albumine and low molecular weight protein urinary excretion. Stomatitis grade III/IV occurred in 25% without versus 0% of patients with amifostine (P = 0.01). Acute nausea/vomiting was frequently observed immediately during or after the application of amifostine despite intensive antiemetic prophylaxis consisting of 5-HT3-receptor antagonists/dexamethasone/trifluorpromazine. However, delayed emesis occurred more often in the control patients. Engraftment of neutrophil (> 500 μl−1) and thrombocytes (> 25 000 μl−1)were observed at days 9 versus 10 and 10 versus 12, respectively, both slightly in favour of the amifostine arm. In addition, a lower number of days with fever and a shortened duration of hospital stay were observed in the amifostine arm. The reduction of acute toxicity observed in the amifostine arm resulted in 30% savings in costs for supportive care (Euro 4396 versus Euro 3153 per patient). Taking into account the drug costs of amifostine, calculation of in-patient treatment costs from the start of chemotherapy to discharge revealed additional costs of Euro 540 per patient in the amifostine arm. This randomized pilot study indicates that both organ and haematotoxicity of HD-VIC chemotherapy can be ameliorated by the use of amifostine. Additionally, a nearly complete preservation of GFR was observed in amifostine-treated patients which may be advantageous if repetitive cycles of HDCT are planned. Larger randomized trials evaluating amifostine cytoprotection during high-dose chemotherapy are warranted. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign http://www.bjcancer.com\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Amifostine \", \"Control\", \"Days with fever\", \"significantly decreased\", \"In addition, a lower number of days with fever and a shortened duration of hospital stay were observed in the amifostine arm.\"], [\"Amifostine \", \"Control\", \"Hospital stay\", \"significantly decreased\", \"In addition, a lower number of days with fever and a shortened duration of hospital stay were observed in the amifostine arm.\"], [\"Amifostine \", \"Control\", \"Grade III/IV stomatitis \", \"significantly decreased\", \"Stomatitis grade III/IV occurred in 25% without versus 0% of patients with amifostine (P = 0.01).\"], [\"Amifostine \", \"Control\", \"Glomerular filtration rate fall\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The median fall of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 10% from baseline in the amifostine group (105 to 95 ml min\\u22121) and 37% in the control patient group (107 to 67 ml min\\u22121) (P\\u003c 0.01).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Fresh Scoparia dulcis porridge elicited a low glycaemic index (GI) and anti-hyperglycaemic effects when fed to diabetic Wistar rats. Commercially produced Scoparia dulcis porridge (SDC) elicited medium GI. Present study was aimed at studying the anti-diabetic effects of consumption of commercially produced S. dulcis porridge.\n\nABSTRACT.METHOD: A randomized crossover clinical trial with type 2 diabetic patients (n = 35) on medication, with mild and moderate diabetes [fasting blood glucose (FBG) 126–300 mg/dL, age 35–70 years] was conducted. Within the first three months (study period 1) group 1 was the test and group 2 was the control. Following a wash-out period, the two groups were crossed over (study period 2: group 1 – control; group 2 - test). Test group consumed commercially produced SDC for 3 days/week for three months and the control group any other food. At the onset and end of each study period glucose measurements [Fasting Blood Glucose (FBG), HbA1c], lipid measurements (total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides, cholesterol ratios), toxicity parameters (liver enzymes, creatinine, CRP, eGFR) were analyzed by enzyme assay kit methods using a KONELAB 20XT auto analyzer. Significances between groups were analyzed by one way ANOVA (normal distribution) and Mann Whitney test (if the values were not normally distributed). Within group comparisons were carried out by Bonferroni post hoc test.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: During the crossover clinical trial HbA1c of group 1 decreased from 7.9 ± 0.5 to 6.5 ± 0.3 (p = 0.003) while HbA1c of group 2 decreased from 7.0 ± 0.3to 6.7 ± 0.3 while in the test group. Therefore, both test groups (1 and 2) elicited a decrease in HbA1c compared to respective control groups. Both test groups elicited a non significant decrease in FBG following the intervention (group 1 - from 174 ± 14 to 160 ± 10 mg/dL; group 2 - from 183 ± 13 to 160 ± 7 mg/dL). No significant differences (p >0.05) in insulin, cholesterol measurements (total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides and cholesterol ratios) and atherogenic index between or within groups were observed. All other measurements (AST, ALT, ALP, creatinine, CRP, eGFR) were normal and not significantly different between or within groups.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Porridge made with SDC leaf extract decreased FBG and HbA1c (p >0.05) of type 2 diabetic patients. The porridge had no effect on cholesterol measurements and no toxicity was observed at the dose tested. Therefore, the SDC porridge can be recommended as a suitable meal for diabetic patients.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Commercially produced Scoparia dulcis porridge (SDC)\", \"Any other food\", \"Liver enzymes\", \"no significant difference\", \"All other measurements (AST, ALT, ALP, creatinine, CRP, eGFR) were normal and not significantly different between or within groups.\"], [\"Commercially produced Scoparia dulcis porridge (SDC)\", \"Any other food\", \"Atherogenic index\", \"no significant difference\", \"No significant differences (p \\u003e0.05) in insulin, cholesterol measurements (total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides and cholesterol ratios) and atherogenic index between or within groups were observed.\"], [\"Commercially produced Scoparia dulcis porridge (SDC)\", \"Any other food\", \"Fasting blood glucose\", \"no significant difference\", \"Both test groups elicited a non significant decrease in FBG following the intervention (group 1 - from 174 \\u00b1 14 to 160 \\u00b1 10 mg/dL; group 2 - from 183 \\u00b1 13 to 160 \\u00b1 7 mg/dL).\"], [\"Commercially produced Scoparia dulcis porridge (SDC)\", \"Any other food\", \"HbA1c levels\", \"significantly decreased\", \"both test groups (1 and 2) elicited a decrease in HbA1c compared to respective control groups.\"], [\"Commercially produced Scoparia dulcis porridge (SDC)\", \"Any other food\", \"Insulin and cholesterol levels\", \"no significant difference\", \"No significant differences (p \\u003e0.05) in insulin, cholesterol measurements (total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides and cholesterol ratios) and atherogenic index between or within groups were observed.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

It has been shown that the subclinical inflammatory responses play important roles in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. In the present study, we determined the effects of metformin on the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-6, TNF-α, and MCP-1) and anti-inflammatory mediator IL-10 in blood and urine of patients with type 2 diabetes. There were 210 patients with type 2 diabetes, which were randomized into metformin (n = 112) and non-metformin (gliclazide, acarbose, and repaglinide, n = 98) groups. The levels of cytokines were measured by the ELISA.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: We found that metformin reduced the levels of IL-6 in blood and MCP-1 in urine, but increased IL-10 levels in blood of patients with type 2 diabetes. There were no significant differences of TNF-α between metformin and non-metformin groups. Furthermore, compared to individual drug treatment, metformin significantly reduced the levels of serum IL-6 and TNF-α, as well as urine MCP-1. When the patients were stratified based on the durations and doses of metformin, we found that there was only change (i.e., increase) in serum IL-10 levels in patients with metformin for more than 1 year compared to treatment for less than 1 year. Metformin (1.5 g) treatment reduced the urinary levels of MCP-1 as compared with dose of 1.0 g in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Metformin reduces inflammatory responses without influence on renal function in type 2 diabetic patients.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"Metformin\", \"Control\", \"Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1\", \"significantly decreased\", \"We found that metformin reduced the levels of IL-6 in blood and MCP-1 in urine, but increased IL-10 levels in blood of patients with type 2 diabetes.\"], [\"Metformin\", \"Control\", \"Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Furthermore, compared to individual drug treatment, metformin significantly reduced the levels of serum IL-6 and TNF-\\u03b1, as well as urine MCP-1.\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:114"}, "target": "[[\"Metformin\", \"Control\", \"Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1\", \"significantly decreased\", \"We found that metformin reduced the levels of IL-6 in blood and MCP-1 in urine, but increased IL-10 levels in blood of patients with type 2 diabetes.\"], [\"Metformin\", \"Control\", \"Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Furthermore, compared to individual drug treatment, metformin significantly reduced the levels of serum IL-6 and TNF-\\u03b1, as well as urine MCP-1.\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

This was a retrospective review of\nopen RFA and hepatic resection for colorectal\nliver metastases between January 1998 and May\n2007. All patients who had RFA were considered\nto have unresectable disease. 58 patients had\nhepatic resection and 43 had RFA. A 5-year\nsurvival after resection was 43% compared to\n23% after RFA. For patients with solitary\nlesions, a 5-year survival was 48% after\nresection and 15% after RFA.

Dual release ciprofloxacin for inhalation (DRCFI) contains liposomal ciprofloxacin, formulated to optimise airway antibiotic delivery.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Phase II, 24-week Australian/New Zealand multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 42 adult bronchiectasis subjects with ≥2 pulmonary exacerbations in the prior 12 months and ciprofloxacin-sensitive P aeruginosa at screening. Subjects received DRCFI or placebo in three treatment cycles of 28 days on/28 days off. The primary outcome was change in sputum P aeruginosa bacterial density to the end of treatment cycle 1 (day 28), analysed by modified intention to treat (mITT). Key secondary outcomes included safety and time to first pulmonary exacerbation—after reaching the pulmonary exacerbation endpoint subjects discontinued study drug although remained in the study.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: DRCFI resulted in a mean (SD) 4.2 (3.7) log10 CFU/g reduction in P aeruginosa bacterial density at day 28 (vs −0.08 (3.8) with placebo, p=0.002). DRCFI treatment delayed time to first pulmonary exacerbation (median 134 vs 58 days, p=0.057 mITT, p=0.046 per protocol). DRCFI was well tolerated with a similar incidence of systemic adverse events to the placebo group, but fewer pulmonary adverse events.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily inhaled DRCFI demonstrated potent antipseudomonal microbiological efficacy in adults with non-CF bronchiectasis and ciprofloxacin-sensitive P aeruginosa.

Furthermore, treatment with insulin in this group is frequently complicated by hypoglycaemia. In healthy patients and those with type 2 diabetes, exogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) decreases blood glucose by suppressing glucagon, stimulating insulin and slowing gastric emptying. Because the former effects are glucose-dependent, the use of GLP-1 is not associated with hypoglycaemia. The objective of this study was to establish if exogenous GLP-1 attenuates the glycaemic response to enteral nutrition in patients with critical illness induced hyperglycaemia.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Seven mechanically ventilated critically ill patients, not previously known to have diabetes, received two intravenous infusions of GLP-1 (1.2 pmol/kg/min) and placebo (4% albumin) over 270 minutes. Infusions were administered on consecutive days in a randomised, double-blind fashion. On both days a mixed nutrient liquid was infused, via a post-pyloric feeding catheter, at a rate of 1.5 kcal/min between 30 and 270 minutes. Blood glucose and plasma GLP-1, insulin and glucagon concentrations were measured.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: In all patients, exogenous GLP-1 infusion reduced the overall glycaemic response during enteral nutrient stimulation (AUC30–270 min GLP-1 (2077 ± 144 mmol/l min) vs placebo (2568 ± 208 mmol/l min); P = 0.02) and the peak blood glucose (GLP-1 (10.1 ± 0.7 mmol/l) vs placebo (12.7 ± 1.0 mmol/l); P < 0.01). The insulin/glucose ratio at 270 minutes was increased with GLP-1 infusion (GLP-1 (9.1 ± 2.7) vs. placebo (5.8 ± 1.8); P = 0.02) but there was no difference in absolute insulin concentrations. There was a transient, non-sustained, reduction in plasma glucagon concentrations during GLP-1 infusion (t = 30 minutes GLP-1 (90 ± 12 pmol/ml) vs. placebo (104 ± 10 pmol/ml); P < 0.01).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Acute, exogenous GLP-1 infusion markedly attenuates the glycaemic response to enteral nutrition in the critically ill. These observations suggest that GLP-1 and/or its analogues have the potential to manage hyperglycaemia in the critically ill.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry number: ACTRN12609000093280.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Exogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 infusion\", \"Control\", \"Peak blood glucose\", \"significantly decreased\", \"In all patients, exogenous GLP-1 infusion reduced the overall glycaemic response during enteral nutrient stimulation (AUC30\\u2013270 min GLP-1 (2077 \\u00b1 144 mmol/l min) vs placebo (2568 \\u00b1 208 mmol/l min); P = 0.02) and the peak blood glucose (GLP-1 (10.1 \\u00b1 0.7 mmol/l) vs placebo (12.7 \\u00b1 1.0 mmol/l); P \\u003c 0.01).\"], [\"Exogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 infusion\", \"Control\", \"Absolute insulin concentrations\", \"no significant difference\", \"The insulin/glucose ratio at 270 minutes was increased with GLP-1 infusion (GLP-1 (9.1 \\u00b1 2.7) vs. placebo (5.8 \\u00b1 1.8); P = 0.02) but there was no difference in absolute insulin concentrations.\"], [\"Exogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 infusion\", \"Control\", \"Glucagon concentrations during infusion\", \"significantly decreased\", \"There was a transient, non-sustained, reduction in plasma glucagon concentrations during GLP-1 infusion (t = 30 minutes GLP-1 (90 \\u00b1 12 pmol/ml) vs. placebo (104 \\u00b1 10 pmol/ml); P \\u003c 0.01).\"], [\"Exogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 infusion\", \"Control\", \"Glycaemic response\", \"significantly decreased\", \"In all patients, exogenous GLP-1 infusion reduced the overall glycaemic response during enteral nutrient stimulation (AUC30\\u2013270 min GLP-1 (2077 \\u00b1 144 mmol/l min) vs placebo (2568 \\u00b1 208 mmol/l min); P = 0.02) and the peak blood glucose (GLP-1 (10.1 \\u00b1 0.7 mmol/l) vs placebo (12.7 \\u00b1 1.0 mmol/l); P \\u003c 0.01).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Caudal dexamethasone and magnesium could offer significant analgesic benefits. We compared the analgesic effects and side-effects of dexamethasone or magnesium added to caudal ropivacaine in pediatric patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:: A total of 105 (1-6 years) were randomly assigned into three groups in a double-blinded manner. After a standardized sevoflurane in oxygen anesthesia, each patient received a single caudal dose of ropivacaine 0.15% 1.5 mL/kg combined with either magnesium 50 mg in normal saline 1 mL (group RM), dexamethasone 0.1 mg/kg in normal saline 1 mL (group RD), or corresponding volume of normal saline (group R) according to group assignment. Postoperative analgesia, use of analgesics, and side-effects were assessed during the first 24 h.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: Addition of magnesium or dexamethasone to caudal ropivacaine significantly prolonged analgesia duration 8 (5-11) h and 12 (8-16) h, respectively compared with 4 (3-5) h with the use of ropivacaine alone. The incidence of postoperative rescue analgesia was significantly higher in group R compared with groups RM and RD. The time to 1st analgesic dose was significantly longer in groups RM and RD (500 ± 190 and 730 ± 260 min) respectively compared with group R (260 ± 65 min). Group R patients achieved significantly higher Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale and Faces Legs Activity Cry Consolability scores (4th hourly) compared with groups RM and RD patients (8th and 12th hourly, respectively).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: The addition of dexamethasone or magnesium to caudal ropivacaine significantly prolonged the duration of postoperative analgesia in children undergoing inguinal hernia repair.

This might be related to the magnitude of the tissue trauma. The aim of the present study was to examine the differences of the neuroendocrine and inflammatory responses between the two surgical techniques.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Twenty-four patients with no major medical disease were randomly assigned to undergo laparoscopic (n = 13) or abdominal hysterectomy (n = 11).

This paradigm might serve as a translational model for (pre)attentive information processing deficits in schizophrenia. This is the first study to investigate the event-related potentials (ERPs) of a within-subject LIrr paradigm in humans. Furthermore, the effects of the muscarinic M1 antagonist biperiden on LIrr were assessed. As expected, LIrr was found to be intact in young healthy volunteers after placebo. Furthermore, in the placebo condition P3b latency was decreased for target stimuli, which were pre-cued. This suggests that the predictability of the occurrence of these stimuli is mainly reflected by this ERP component. Biperiden had no effect on the behavioural LIrr measures, although prolonged reaction times were evident. Biperiden increased the N1 amplitude of the pre-exposed predictor letters, suggesting an effect of this drug on early perceptual processing. In conclusion, the within-subject paradigm used in the current study in combination with electroencephalography can reveal brain mechanisms involved in LIrr. M1 antagonism did not affect LIrr performance but seemed to influence early information processing.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Biperiden\", \"Placebo\", \"Learned irrelevance index\", \"no significant difference\", \"Biperiden had no effect on the behavioural LIrr measures,\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Very few studies have compared the effect of bispectral index (BIS) monitoring versus standard end-tidal anesthetic gas (ETAG) concentration monitoring on tracheal extubation time for halothane-based anesthesia. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of BIS versus ETAG-guided anesthesia on time to tracheal extubation for halothane-based anesthesia in general surgical setting.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS:: This was a randomized, controlled double-blind study. Sixty patients with the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status Class 1 or 2, receiving halothane-based general anesthesia were randomized to BIS-guided (n = 30) and ETAG-guided anesthesia (n = 30). Time to tracheal extubation was measured. In BIS group, BIS value was kept between 40 and 60 while in ETAG group; ETAG value was kept between 0.7 and 1.3 minimum alveolar concentration. The two groups were compared using Student's t-test, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

This study was planned with an aim to study and compare the conventional clinical end point or BIS on the requirement of dosage of propofol, hemodynamic effects, and BIS alterations following propofol induction.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS:: 70 patients, ASA I and II, 20-60 years undergoing elective surgical procedure under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation were selected and divided into two groups. Group A received (inj.) fentanyl (2 μg/kg), followed 3 min later by inj. propofol at the rate of 30 mg/kg/hr infusion till the loss of response to verbal command while group B received inj. fentanyl (2 μg/kg), followed 3 min later by inj. propofol at the rate of 30 mg/kg/hr infusion. The end point of hypnosis was when the BIS value was sustained for 1 min at 48±2. The patients were intubated. Total induction dose of propofol was noted in each group. The value of BIS and hemodynamic parameters (heart rate, systolic/diastolic blood pressure) were noted at the time of loss of consciousness, at the time of intubation, and 1 min after intubation, thereafter every minute for first 10 min and thereafter every 10 min till end of surgery. Any involuntary muscle activity such as jerky movements, dystonic posturing, and opisthotonos were also recorded.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: The mean dose of propofol used in groups A and B were 1.85±0.48 mg/kg and 1.79±0.41 mg/kg, respectively. The dosage used in group B were less but not clinically significant (P=0.575). On comparing the dosage of propofol in males among the groups there was a significantly lower dosage of propofol required in group B (2.06±0.45 mg/kg and 1.83±0.32 mg/kg, respectively, P=0.016). This decrease however was not seen in female patients dosage being 1.65±0.44 mg/kg and 1.75±0.49 mg/kg, respectively (P=0.372). The hemodynamic variables including heart rate, systolic/diastolic blood pressure and BIS were comparable within the group at induction, post-induction, and intubation. However, there was a significant increase in all the parameters at postintubation readings (P<0.001).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: No significant difference in the induction dose of propofol was observed when assessed clinically (loss of verbal response) or by BIS monitoring. Traditional teaching to titrate the dose of propofol and depth of anesthesia during intubation by loss of verbal response is as good as BIS value monitoring.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"propofol induction guided by BIS\", \"propofol induction guided by clinical signs\", \"mean dose of propofol required for induction\", \"no significant difference\", \"No significant difference in the induction dose of propofol was observed when assessed clinically (loss of verbal response) or by BIS monitoring.\"], [\"propofol induction guided by BIS\", \"propofol induction guided by clinical signs\", \"dosage of propofol required by females\", \"no significant difference\", \"The mean dose of propofol used in groups A and B were 1.85\\u00b10.48 mg/kg and 1.79\\u00b10.41 mg/kg, respectively.

We studied two different doses of neostigmine.\n\nABSTRACT.PATIENTS & METHODS:: A randomized double blind study was conducted on ninety adult females scheduled for lower intra abdominal surgeries. The study was designed to compare two doses of epidural neostigmine co administered with lignocaine, with regard to its analgesic efficacy and its effect on sedation in postoperative period. Patients were divided into three groups of 30 each. Group I received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with normal saline (1ml), group II lignocaine1% (9ml) with neostigmine 100μg in saline (1ml) and group III received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with neostigmine 200μg in NS (1ml). Group I served as a control. In operating room, after putting epidural catheter, general anesthesia was administered with propofol (2mg kg-1), succinylcholine (2mg kg-1) and maintained with O2, N2O, relaxant technique. At the end of surgery, patients were reversed. Epidural analgesic medication was administered to after proper recovery from anesthesia. Intensity of pain relief on VAS, duration of analgesia, level of sensory block, motor blockade, sedation by sedation score and complications were assessed.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: The addition of neostigmine resulted in significant longer duration of analgesia (dose independent) and sedation (dose dependent). Sensory and motor blockade were identical in all three groups. There was no incidence of respiratory depression, pruritus, bradycardia or hypotension in any group. Two patients in control group and one, receiving neostigmine (200μg), developed nausea/vomiting.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: Co administration of epidural neostigmine and lignocaine appears to be a useful technique for postoperative analgesia as it increases the duration of analgesia and provides desirable sedation at the same time.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"Group I received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with normal saline (1ml)\", \"group II lignocaine1% (9ml) with neostigmine 100\\u03bcg in saline (1ml) and group III received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with neostigmine 200\\u03bcg in NS (1ml)\", \"sensory blockade\", \"no significant difference\", \"Sensory and motor blockade were identical in all three groups.\"], [\"Group I received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with normal saline (1ml)\", \"group II lignocaine1% (9ml) with neostigmine 100\\u03bcg in saline (1ml) and group III received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with neostigmine 200\\u03bcg in NS (1ml)\", \"duration of analgesia\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The addition of neostigmine resulted in significant longer duration of analgesia (dose independent) and sedation (dose dependent).\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:120"}, "target": "[[\"Group I received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with normal saline (1ml)\", \"group II lignocaine1% (9ml) with neostigmine 100\\u03bcg in saline (1ml) and group III received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with neostigmine 200\\u03bcg in NS (1ml)\", \"sensory blockade\", \"no significant difference\", \"Sensory and motor blockade were identical in all three groups.\"], [\"Group I received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with normal saline (1ml)\", \"group II lignocaine1% (9ml) with neostigmine 100\\u03bcg in saline (1ml) and group III received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with neostigmine 200\\u03bcg in NS (1ml)\", \"duration of analgesia\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The addition of neostigmine resulted in significant longer duration of analgesia (dose independent) and sedation (dose dependent).\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

In particular, data on quality of life is rarely reported. This is especially important because patients treated with hydrotherapy often report an enhanced sense of well-being. We report a randomised controlled trial in which we compared the effects of hydrotherapy with exercises on land on overall response to treatment, physical function and quality of life in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: One hundred and fifteen patients with RA were randomised to receive a weekly 30-minute session of hydrotherapy or similar exercises on land for 6 weeks. Our primary outcome was a self-rated global impression of change – a measure of treatment effect on a 7-point scale ranging from 1(very much worse) to 7 (very much better) assessed immediately on completion of treatment. Secondary outcomes including EuroQol health related quality of life, EuroQol health status valuation, HAQ, 10 metre walk time and pain scores were collected at baseline, after treatment and 3 months later. Binary outcomes were analysed by Fisher's exact test and continuous variables by Wilcoxon or Mann-Whitney tests.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Baseline characteristics of the two groups were comparable. Significantly more patients treated with hydrotherapy (40/46, 87%) were much better or very much better than the patients treated with land exercise (19/40, 47.5%), p < 0.001 Fisher's exact test. Eleven patients allocated land exercise failed to complete treatment compared with 4 patients allocated hydrotherapy (p = 0.09). Sensitivity analyses confirmed an advantage for hydrotherapy if we assumed non-completers would all not have responded (response rates 70% versus 38%; p < 0.001) or if we assumed that non-completers would have had the same response as completers (response rates 82% versus 55% p = 0.002). Ten metre walk time improved after treatment in both cases (median pre-treatment time for both groups combined 10.9 seconds, post-treatment 9.1 s, and 3 months later 9.6 s). There was however no difference between treatment groups. Similarly there were no significant differences between groups in terms of changes to HAQ, EQ-5D utility score, EQ VAS and pain VAS.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Patients with RA treated with hydrotherapy are more likely to report feeling much better or very much better than those treated with land exercises immediately on completion of the treatment programme. This perceived benefit was not reflected by differences between groups in 10-metre walk times, functional scores, quality of life measures and pain scores.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"receive a weekly 30-minute session of hydrotherapy for 6 weeks\", \"similar exercises on land for 6 weeks\", \"number of patients that feel much better\", \"significantly increased\", \"Significantly more patients treated with hydrotherapy (40/46, 87%) were much better or very much better than the patients treated with land exercise (19/40, 47.5%), p \\u003c 0.001 Fisher\\u0027s exact test.\"], [\"receive a weekly 30-minute session of hydrotherapy for 6 weeks\", \"similar exercises on land for 6 weeks\", \"number of patient failed to complete treatment\", \"no significant difference\", \"Eleven patients allocated land exercise failed to complete treatment compared with 4 patients allocated hydrotherapy (p = 0.09).\"], [\"receive a weekly 30-minute session of hydrotherapy for 6 weeks\", \"similar exercises on land for 6 weeks\", \"Ten-metre walk time\", \"no significant difference\", \"Ten metre walk time improved after treatment in both cases (median pre-treatment time for both groups combined 10.9 seconds, post-treatment 9.1 s, and 3 months later 9.6 s).

Group I received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with normal saline (1ml), group II lignocaine1% (9ml) with neostigmine 100μg in saline (1ml) and group III received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with neostigmine 200μg in NS (1ml). Group I served as a control. In operating room, after putting epidural catheter, general anesthesia was administered with propofol (2mg kg-1), succinylcholine (2mg kg-1) and maintained with O2, N2O, relaxant technique. At the end of surgery, patients were reversed. Epidural analgesic medication was administered to after proper recovery from anesthesia. Intensity of pain relief on VAS, duration of analgesia, level of sensory block, motor blockade, sedation by sedation score and complications were assessed.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: The addition of neostigmine resulted in significant longer duration of analgesia (dose independent) and sedation (dose dependent). Sensory and motor blockade were identical in all three groups. There was no incidence of respiratory depression, pruritus, bradycardia or hypotension in any group. Two patients in control group and one, receiving neostigmine (200μg), developed nausea/vomiting.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: Co administration of epidural neostigmine and lignocaine appears to be a useful technique for postoperative analgesia as it increases the duration of analgesia and provides desirable sedation at the same time.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[[\"lignocaine 1% (9ml) with neostigmine 100μg in saline (1ml)\", \"lignocaine 1% (9ml) with normal saline (1ml)\", \"duration of analgesia\", \"significantly increased\", \"The addition of neostigmine resulted in significant longer duration of analgesia (dose independent)\"], [\"lignocaine 1% (9ml) with neostigmine 200μg in NS (1ml)\", \"lignocaine 1% (9ml) with normal saline (1ml)\", \"sedation\", \"significantly increased\", \"The addition of neostigmine resulted in significant longer duration of analgesia (dose independent) and sedation (dose dependent)\"]]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[[\"lignocaine 1% (9ml) with neostigmine 100μg in saline (1ml)\", \"lignocaine 1% (9ml) with normal saline (1ml)\", \"duration of analgesia\", \"significantly increased\", \"The addition of neostigmine resulted in significant longer duration of analgesia (dose independent)\"], [\"lignocaine 1% (9ml) with neostigmine 200μg in NS (1ml)\", \"lignocaine 1% (9ml) with normal saline (1ml)\", \"sedation\", \"significantly increased\", \"The addition of neostigmine resulted in significant longer duration of analgesia (dose independent) and sedation (dose dependent)\"]]"], "doc_hash": "18d9656a42603a8d836503bddf6700c15b33dbfb94fff28807647667f090e20e", "prompt_hash": "72e221691f06c6dcf6b95c077392817bac653592ef5b28fa91705a510f2e2e62", "target_hash": "d2f87266f250c1ae1b9cc6f19b79031704f6e8fb20b2d69c6b2e15ec624dcfcf", "bypass": null}

The objectives of this study were to determine whether vitamin D supplementation to patients with tuberculosis (TB) could influence recovery.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Two hundred and fifty nine patients with pulmonary TB were randomized to receive either 600,000 IU of Intramuscular vitamin D3 or placebo for 2 doses. Assessments were performed at 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Early secreted and T cell activated 6 kDa (ESAT6) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis sonicate (MTBs) antigen induced whole blood stimulated IFN-g responses were measured at 0 and 12 weeks. Statistical comparisons between outcome variables at 0 and 12 weeks were performed using Student's t-test and Chi2 tests.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: After 12 weeks, the vitamin D supplemented arm demonstrated significantly greater mean weight gain (kg) + 3.75, (3.16 – 4.34) versus + 2.61 (95% CI 1.99 – 3.23) p 0.009 and lesser residual disease by chest radiograph; number of zones involved 1.35 v/s 1.82 p 0.004 (95% CI 0.15, 0.79) and 50% or greater reduction in cavity size 106 (89.8%) v/s 111 (94.8%), p 0.035. Vitamin D supplementation led to significant increase in MTBs-induced IFN-g secretion in patients with baseline 'Deficient' 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum levels (p 0.021).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation with high doses of vitamin D accelerated clinical, radiographic improvement in all TB patients and increased host immune activation in patients with baseline 'Deficient' serum vitamin D levels.

Outcome was based on the effects of insulin therapy on biochemical and hormonal changes during treatment and recovery of DKA. <p> RESULTS—The load group reached a peak in free insulin value (460 μU/ml) within 5 min and plateaued at 88 μU/ml in 60 min. The twice no load group reached a peak (200 μU/ml) at 45 min. The no load group reached a peak (60 μU/ml) in 60–120 min. Five patients in the no load group required supplemental insulin doses to decrease initial glucose levels by 10%; patients in the twice no load and load groups did not. Except for these differences, times to reach glucose ≤250 mg/dl, pH ≥7.3, and HCO3− ≥15 mEq/l did not differ significantly among the three groups. <p> CONCLUSIONS—A priming dose in low-dose insulin therapy in patients with DKA is unnecessary if an adequate dose of regular insulin of 0.14 unit · kg body weight−1 · h−1 (about 10 units/h in a 70-kg patient) is given.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"Insulin 0.07 IU/kg infusion\", \"Insulin 0.07 IU/kg load + 0.07 IU/kg infusion\", \"Time for reaching glucose predetermined values \", \"no significant difference\", \", times to reach glucose \\u2264250 mg/dl, pH \\u22657.3, and HCO3\\u2212 \\u226515 mEq/l did not differ significantly among the three groups.\"], [\"Insulin 0.07 IU/kg infusion\", \"Insulin 0.07 IU/kg load + 0.07 IU/kg infusion\", \"Time for reaching bicarbonate predetermined values \", \"no significant difference\", \", times to reach glucose \\u2264250 mg/dl, pH \\u22657.3, and HCO3\\u2212 \\u226515 mEq/l did not differ significantly among the three groups.\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:122"}, "target": "[[\"Insulin 0.07 IU/kg infusion\", \"Insulin 0.07 IU/kg load + 0.07 IU/kg infusion\", \"Time for reaching glucose predetermined values \", \"no significant difference\", \", times to reach glucose \\u2264250 mg/dl, pH \\u22657.3, and HCO3\\u2212 \\u226515 mEq/l did not differ significantly among the three groups.\"], [\"Insulin 0.07 IU/kg infusion\", \"Insulin 0.07 IU/kg load + 0.07 IU/kg infusion\", \"Time for reaching bicarbonate predetermined values \", \"no significant difference\", \", times to reach glucose \\u2264250 mg/dl, pH \\u22657.3, and HCO3\\u2212 \\u226515 mEq/l did not differ significantly among the three groups.\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

Outcome was based on the effects of insulin therapy on biochemical and hormonal changes during treatment and recovery of DKA. <p> RESULTS—The load group reached a peak in free insulin value (460 μU/ml) within 5 min and plateaued at 88 μU/ml in 60 min. The twice no load group reached a peak (200 μU/ml) at 45 min. The no load group reached a peak (60 μU/ml) in 60–120 min. Five patients in the no load group required supplemental insulin doses to decrease initial glucose levels by 10%; patients in the twice no load and load groups did not. Except for these differences, times to reach glucose ≤250 mg/dl, pH ≥7.3, and HCO3− ≥15 mEq/l did not differ significantly among the three groups. <p> CONCLUSIONS—A priming dose in low-dose insulin therapy in patients with DKA is unnecessary if an adequate dose of regular insulin of 0.14 unit · kg body weight−1 · h−1 (about 10 units/h in a 70-kg patient) is given.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[[\"insulin priming dose with a continuous insulin infusion\", \"two continuous infusions without a priming dose\", \"recovery of DKA\", \"significantly increased\", \"times to reach glucose ≤250 mg/dl, pH ≥7.3, and HCO3− ≥15 mEq/l did not differ significantly among the three groups.\"], [\"insulin priming dose with a continuous insulin infusion\", \"two continuous infusions without a priming dose\", \"peak in free insulin value\", \"significantly increased\", \"The load group reached a peak in free insulin value (460 μU/ml) within 5 min and plateaued at 88 μU/ml in 60 min.

Antenatal care has the potential to reduce maternal morbidity and improve newborns' survival but this benefit may not be realized in sub-Saharan Africa where the attendance and quality of care is declining. We evaluated the association between a mobile phone intervention and antenatal care in a resource-limited setting. We aimed to assess antenatal care in a comprehensive way taking into consideration utilisation of antenatal care as well as content and timing of interventions during pregnancy.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: This study was an open label pragmatic cluster-randomised controlled trial with primary healthcare facilities in Zanzibar as the unit of randomisation. 2550 pregnant women (1311 interventions and 1239 controls) who attended antenatal care at selected primary healthcare facilities were included at their first antenatal care visit and followed until 42 days after delivery. 24 primary health care facilities in six districts were randomized to either mobile phone intervention or standard care. The intervention consisted of a mobile phone text-message and voucher component. Primary outcome measure was four or more antenatal care visits during pregnancy. Secondary outcome measures were tetanus vaccination, preventive treatment for malaria, gestational age at last antenatal care visit, and antepartum referral.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The mobile phone intervention was associated with an increase in antenatal care attendance. In the intervention group 44% of the women received four or more antenatal care visits versus 31% in the control group (OR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.03-5.55). There was a trend towards improved timing and quality of antenatal care services across all secondary outcome measures although not statistically significant.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: The wired mothers' mobile phone intervention significantly increased the proportion of women receiving the recommended four antenatal care visits during pregnancy and there was a trend towards improved quality of care with more women receiving preventive health services, more women attending antenatal care late in pregnancy and more women with antepartum complications identified and referred.

A conclusion is yet to be reached on the role of crystalloids and colloids in immediate fluid therapy. This study was done to determine the suitable solution in immediate resuscitation of patients with hemorrhagic shock caused by tissue trauma.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: One hundred trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock, who underwent fluid therapy in the emergency unit, were assigned randomly to two groups of hydroxyethyl starch (Voluven) and normal saline. Before and after fluid therapy, 1 cc of blood was taken from all patients in order to determine and compare base excess levels.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: In hydroxyethyl starch (Voluven) and normal saline groups, base excess level after solution therapy increased about 9.65 and 5.46 volumes, respectively, in which augmentation in hydroxyethyl starch (Voluven) group is significantly higher than normal saline group (P ≤ 0.001).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: By using hydroxyethyl starch (Voluven) for fluid therapy in hemorrhagic shock caused by trauma, serum base excess decreases and results in improvement in tissue perfusion and better balance in acid-base status and it seems to be superior over normal saline administration, but the building block of the ideal fluid therapy should still remain with the physician's final clinical judgment.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Hydroxyethyl starch (Voluven)\", \"Normal saline\", \"Level of base excess after therapy\", \"significantly increased\", \"In hydroxyethyl starch (Voluven) and normal saline groups, base excess level after solution therapy increased about 9.65 and 5.46 volumes, respectively, in which augmentation in hydroxyethyl starch (Voluven) group is significantly higher than normal saline group (P \\u2264 0.001).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Applying an available and appropriate supplementary food is a major approach in treating children with Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM).\n\nABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of a new supplementary blended flour (containing chickpea, rice, wheat and barley, named Shadameen) in combination with multivitamin/mineral supplement and nutritional counseling versus multivitamin/mineral supplement and nutritional counseling alone, in the treatment of children with MAM.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: This randomized controlled trial study was conducted at Heshmatiyeh Hospital in Sabzevar city in Iran, from January 2016 to December 2016. Seventy infants, aged 9 to 24 months with MAM who were referred from urban health centers to the hospital clinic were included. They were randomly assigned to receive, for about 3 months, either multivitamin / mineral supplement and nutritional counseling alone or in combination with an extra supplementary blended food. We analyzed weight, length, weight for length Z score (WLZ), weight for age Z score (WAZ) and length for weight Z score (LAZ), along with recovery rate and adverse events among the two groups. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 16. We used statistics, Chi-square, independent t-test, and Fisher's exact test for the analyses of primary and secondary outcomes.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The food supplementation infant's mean weight and WLZ and WAZ were greater compared with the other group (0.81±0.29 gr and 0.55±0.33 gr, p=0.002), (0.36±0.36 and 0.02±0.52, p=0.003), (0.40±0.33 and 0.09±0.37, p=0.001). The recovery rate in the food supplemented group was significantly higher than the other group (68.4%, 31.6%, p=0.001). No adverse reactions were observed.

To investigate H. pylori infection rate and evaluate a combined set of tests for H. pylori diagnosis in Vietnamese patients with acute peptic ulcer bleeding (PUD). Methods. Consecutive patients with acute PUB were enrolled prospectively. Rapid urease test (RUT) with 3 biopsies was carried out randomly. Patients without RUT or with negative RUT received urea breath test (UBT) and serological and urinary H. pylori antibody tests. H. pylori was considered positive if RUT or any noninvasive test was positive. Patients were divided into group A (RUT plus noninvasive tests) and group B (only noninvasive tests). Results. The overall H. pylori infection rate was 94.2% (161/171). Groups A and B had no differences in demographic characteristics, bleeding severity, endoscopic findings, and proton pump inhibitor use. H. pylori-positive rate in group A was significantly higher than that in group B (98.2% versus 86.7%, p = 0.004). The positive rate of RUT was similar at each biopsy site but significantly increased if RUT results from 2 or 3 sites were combined (p < 0.05). Conclusions.

We developed a highly-structured manualized eight-session cognitive-behavioral program with a focus on subthreshold depression in the workplace and to be administered via telephone by trained psychotherapists (tCBT).\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: We conducted a parallel-group, non-blinded randomized controlled trial of tCBT in addition to the pre-existing Employee Assistance Program (EAP) versus EAP alone among workers with subthreshold depression at a large manufacturing company in Japan. The primary outcomes were depression severity as measured with Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and presenteeism as measured with World Health Organization Health and Work Productivity Questionnaire (HPQ). In the course of the trial the follow-up period was shortened in order to increase acceptability of the study.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The planned sample size was 108 per arm but the trial was stopped early due to low accrual. Altogether 118 subjects were randomized to tCBT+EAP (n = 58) and to EAP alone (n = 60). The BDI-II scores fell from the mean of 17.3 at baseline to 11.0 in the intervention group and to 15.7 in the control group after 4 months (p<0.001, Effect size = 0.69, 95%CI: 0.32 to 1.05). However, there was no statistically significant decrease in absolute and relative presenteeism (p = 0.44, ES = 0.15, −0.21 to 0.52, and p = 0.50, ES = 0.02, −0.34 to 0.39, respectively).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Remote CBT, including tCBT, may provide easy access to quality-assured effective psychotherapy for people in the work force who present with subthreshold depression. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in longer terms. The study was funded by Sekisui Chemicals Co.

This study aimed to compare HRQOL in patients with advanced gastric cancer (GC) receiving either a standard or an experimental treatment.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Seventy-one patients have been treated in Cancer Institute (Tehran, Iran) with docetaxel, cisplatin, 5 FU (TCF) or epirubicin, cisplatin, 5-FU (ECF) and were followed from Jan 2002 to Jan 2005. End points were response rate, HRQOL and survival. HRQOL was assessed using the EORCT QLQ-C30 at baseline and after the third cycle of chemotherapy.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The baseline HRQOL scores were comparable between two groups. After treatment improvement was seen in a number of items and domains except for cognitive functioning, and diarrhoea. Pain decreased and physical functioning improved in both groups. However, only the TCF group showed statistically and clinically meaningful improvement in global QOL (P = 0.001). Surgical and pathologic response was better with TCF but there was no difference in survival rate between two groups.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Docetaxel based treatment (TCF) showed better palliation and improvement of global QOL as compared with epirubicin based treatment (ECF).

The postoperative blood loss, transfusion requirement, cost effectiveness and complications were noted. The groups had similar characteristics. The mean volume of drainage fluid was 270 ml and 620 ml for unilateral(U/L) and bilateral(B/L) TKR patients in placebo group. Whereas it was 160ml and 286 ml respectively in unilateral(U/L) and bilateral(B/L) TKR patients who received tranexamic acid. This was considered statistically significant. Control group patients received 26 units of PRBC as compared to 4 units in tranexamic acid groups (p<0.001). This was again statistically significant. None of the patients in any of the groups developed deep vein thrombosis. Tranexamic acid decreased total blood loss by nearly 54% in B/L TKR and 40% in U/L TKR and drastically reduced (> 80%) blood transfusion.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"tranexamic acid\", \"placebo\", \"postoperative blood loss\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The mean volume of drainage fluid was 270 ml and 620 ml for unilateral(U/L) and bilateral(B/L) TKR patients in placebo group.

This suggests that macrophage activation is involved in the pathogenesis of conditions is characterised by adaptions in the lipid metabolism. Since sCD163 is shed to serum by inflammatory signals including lipopolysaccharides (LPS, endotoxin), we investigated sCD163 and correlations with lipid metabolism following LPS exposure.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Eight healthy male subjects were investigated on two separate occasions: (i) following an LPS exposure and (ii) following saline exposure. Each study day consisted of a four-hour non-insulin-stimulated period followed by a two-hour hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp period. A 3H-palmitate tracer was used to calculate the rate of appearance (Rapalmitate). Blood samples were consecutively obtained throughout each study day.

This study aims to determine the cost-effectiveness of the COACH program in comparison with usual care from a societal perspective.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: A controlled clinical trial was performed at the Internal Medicine department of a general teaching hospital. All admitted patients using at least one prescription drug were included. The COACH program consisted of medication reconciliation, patient counselling at discharge, and communication to healthcare providers in primary care. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with an unplanned rehospitalisation within three months after discharge. Also, the number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was assessed. Cost data were collected using cost diaries. Uncertainty surrounding cost differences and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios between the groups was estimated by bootstrapping.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: In the COACH program, 168 patients were included and in usual care 151 patients. There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients with unplanned rehospitalisations (mean difference 0.17%, 95% CI -8.85;8.51), and in QALYs (mean difference -0.0085, 95% CI -0.0170;0.0001). Total costs for the COACH program were non-significantly lower than usual care (-€1160, 95% CI -3168;847). Cost-effectiveness planes showed that the program was not cost-effective compared with usual care for unplanned rehospitalisations and QALYs gained.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: The COACH program was not cost-effective in comparison with usual care.

In Experiment 1, COCs (n = 420) were randomly assigned to four groups: 1) Control group: no treatment; 2) VS1 group: COCs were exposed to vitrification solution 1 (VS1) containing 7.5% ethylene glycol [EG] + 7.5% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] + 20% calf serum [CS] in TCM-199 at 37 C for 5 min; 3) VS1 + VS2 group: COCs were exposed to VS1 for 5 min followed by VS2 (15% EG + 15% DMSO + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS) at 37 C for 45–60 sec; and 4) Vitrified group: COCs were exposed to VS1 and VS2, loaded on cryotops, vitrified in liquid nitrogen and then warmed in TCM-199 + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS at 37 C for 1 min. In Experiment 2, COCs (n = 581) were assigned to the same groups, but those in VS1, VS1 + VS2 and Vitrified groups were sub-divided and exposed to the warming solution for either 1 or 5 min.

[Subjects and Methods] A total of 46 older drivers\nwith a driver's license participated in this study. All participants were evaluated with\nDriver 65 Plus. They were classified into three groups of \"safe,\" \"caution\" and \"stop,\"\nand examined for cognitive functions with Trail Making Test and Montreal Cognitive\nAssessment-K. The cognitive test results of the three groups were compared. [Results]\nTrail Making Test-A, Trail Making Test-B, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment-K showed a\nsignificant difference between the three groups. The safe group showed significantly\nhigher ability than the caution and stop groups in the three cognitive tests.

In Experiment 1, COCs (n = 420) were randomly assigned to four groups: 1) Control group: no treatment; 2) VS1 group: COCs were exposed to vitrification solution 1 (VS1) containing 7.5% ethylene glycol [EG] + 7.5% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] + 20% calf serum [CS] in TCM-199 at 37 C for 5 min; 3) VS1 + VS2 group: COCs were exposed to VS1 for 5 min followed by VS2 (15% EG + 15% DMSO + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS) at 37 C for 45–60 sec; and 4) Vitrified group: COCs were exposed to VS1 and VS2, loaded on cryotops, vitrified in liquid nitrogen and then warmed in TCM-199 + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS at 37 C for 1 min. In Experiment 2, COCs (n = 581) were assigned to the same groups, but those in VS1, VS1 + VS2 and Vitrified groups were sub-divided and exposed to the warming solution for either 1 or 5 min. After treatment and/or warming, all COCs in both experiments underwent in vitro maturation, in vitro fertilization and in vitro culture.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Cleavage and blastocyst rates did not differ among Control, VS1 and VS1 + VS2 groups in either experiment. In Experiment 2, there was no effect of time in the warming solution. <p> However, both cleavage and blastocyst rates were lower (P < 0.001) in the Vitrified group than in the Control, VS1 and VS1 + VS2 groups (40.9 and 1.6% vs 92.2 and 34.4%, 79.4 and 25.2%, and 80.2 and 20.8%, respectively in Experiment 1, and 25.0 and 1.7% vs 75.3 and 27.2%, 67.9 and 19.5%, and 62.7 and 22.5%, respectively in Experiment 2).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: The permeating cryoprotectants (EG and DMSO) present in VS1 and VS2 solutions and the time in the warming solution containing sucrose had no adverse effects on cleavage and blastocyst rates of immature bovine COCs.

Outpatient IOL is an attractive option to reduce these impacts. To date there is little data comparing outpatient and inpatient IOL methods, and potential safety concerns (hyperstimulation) if prostaglandins, the standard inpatient IOL medications, are used in the outpatient setting. The purpose of this study was to assess feasibility, clinical effectiveness and patient acceptability of outpatient Foley catheter (OPC) vs. inpatient vaginal PGE2 (IP) for induction of labour (IOL) at term.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Women with an unfavourable cervix requiring IOL at term (N = 101) were randomised to outpatient care using Foley catheter (OPC, n = 50) or inpatient care using vaginal PGE2 (IP, n = 51). OPC group had Foley catheter inserted and were discharged overnight following a reassuring cardiotocograph. IP group received 2 mg/1 mg vaginal PGE2 if nulliparous or 1 mg/1 mg if multiparous. Main outcome measures were inpatient stay (prior to birth, in Birthing Unit, total), mode of birth, induction to delivery interval, adverse reactions and patient satisfaction.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: OPC group had shorter hospital stay prior to birth (21.3 vs. 32.4 hrs, p < .001), IP were more likely to achieve vaginal birth within 12 hours of presenting to Birthing Unit (53% vs. 28%, p = .01). Vaginal birth rates (66% OPC Vs. 71% IP), total induction to delivery time (33.5 hrs vs. 31.3 hrs) and total inpatient times (96 hrs OPC Vs. 105 hrs IP) were similar. OPC group felt less pain (significant discomfort 26% Vs 58%, p = .003), and had more sleep (5.8 Vs 3.4 hours, p < .001), during cervical preparation, but were more likely to require oxytocin IOL (88 Vs 59%, p = .001).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: OPC was feasible and acceptable for IOL of women with an unfavourable cervix at term compared to IP, however did not show a statistically significant reduction in total inpatient stay and was associated with increased oxytocin IOL.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN:12609000420246.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Outpatient Foley catheter\", \"Inpatient vaginal PGE2\", \"Vaginal birth rate\", \"no significant difference\", \"Vaginal birth rates (66% OPC Vs. 71% IP), total induction to delivery time (33.5 hrs vs. 31.3 hrs) and total inpatient times (96 hrs OPC Vs. 105 hrs IP) were similar.\"], [\"Outpatient Foley catheter\", \"Inpatient vaginal PGE2\", \"Induction to delivery time\", \"no significant difference\", \").

The objective of the Syndromic Surveillance Evaluation Study was to develop and implement standardized supports in local public health agencies in Ontario, Canada, and evaluate the ability of these supports to affect actions taken as part of public health communicable disease control programs.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Local public health agencies (LPHA) in Ontario, which used syndromic surveillance based on emergency department visits for respiratory disease, were recruited and randomly allocated to the study intervention or control group. The intervention group health agencies received standardized supports in terms of a standardized aberrant event detection algorithm and a response protocol dictating steps to investigate and assess the public health significance of syndromic surveillance alerts. The control group continued with their pre-existing syndromic surveillance infrastructure and processes. Outcomes were assessed using logbooks, which collected quantitative and qualitative information about alerts received, investigation steps taken, and public health responses. The study was conducted prospectively for 15 months (October 2013 to February 2015).\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Fifteen LPHAs participated in the study (n = 9 intervention group, n = 6 control group). A total of 1,969 syndromic surveillance alerts were received by all LPHAs. Variations in the types and amount of responses varied by LPHA, in particularly differences were noted by the size of the health unit. Smaller health units had more challenges to both detect and mount a response to any alerts. LPHAs in the control group were more likely to declare alerts to have public health significance and to initiate any action. Regression models using repeated measures showed an interaction between the year (Year 1 versus Year 2) and the intervention as well as an interaction between year and sustained nature of the alert. Both of these were linked to the control health units reporting more \"watchful waiting\".\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: This study raises questions about the effectiveness of using standardized protocols to improve the performance of syndromic surveillance in a decentralized public health system. Despite efforts to create standardized protocols and engage public health agencies in the process, no significant differences in the effective use of syndromic alerts were observed beyond year 1. It also raises questions about the minimum capacity of the agency and minimum population size that are required for an effective response.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"Standardized aberrant event detection algorithm and response protocol\", \"Pre-existing syndromic surveillance infrastructure and processes\", \"Effective use of syndromic alerts after 1 year\", \"no significant difference\", \"Despite efforts to create standardized protocols and engage public health agencies in the process, no significant differences in the effective use of syndromic alerts were observed beyond year 1.\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:13"}, "target": "[[\"Standardized aberrant event detection algorithm and response protocol\", \"Pre-existing syndromic surveillance infrastructure and processes\", \"Effective use of syndromic alerts after 1 year\", \"no significant difference\", \"Despite efforts to create standardized protocols and engage public health agencies in the process, no significant differences in the effective use of syndromic alerts were observed beyond year 1.\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

Japanese patients who met the criteria were randomized to trial group and the combination diuretic group (received 7.5 mg of tolvaptan) or the conventional diuretic group (received 40 mg of furosemide) for 7 d in addition to the natriuretic drug which was used prior to enrolment in this study. The primary endpoint was the change in body weight from the baseline. Vital signs, fluid intake, and laboratory and urinary data were assessed to determine the pharmacological effects after administration of aquaretic and natriuretic drugs.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: A total of 56 patients were randomized to receive either tolvaptan (n = 28) or furosemide (n = 28). In the combination and conventional diuretic groups, the average decrease in body weight from the baseline was 3.21 ± 3.17 kg (P < 0.0001) and 1.75 ± 2.36 kg (P = 0.0006), respectively, when measured on the final dosing day.

The objective of the Syndromic Surveillance Evaluation Study was to develop and implement standardized supports in local public health agencies in Ontario, Canada, and evaluate the ability of these supports to affect actions taken as part of public health communicable disease control programs.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Local public health agencies (LPHA) in Ontario, which used syndromic surveillance based on emergency department visits for respiratory disease, were recruited and randomly allocated to the study intervention or control group. The intervention group health agencies received standardized supports in terms of a standardized aberrant event detection algorithm and a response protocol dictating steps to investigate and assess the public health significance of syndromic surveillance alerts. The control group continued with their pre-existing syndromic surveillance infrastructure and processes. Outcomes were assessed using logbooks, which collected quantitative and qualitative information about alerts received, investigation steps taken, and public health responses. The study was conducted prospectively for 15 months (October 2013 to February 2015).\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Fifteen LPHAs participated in the study (n = 9 intervention group, n = 6 control group). A total of 1,969 syndromic surveillance alerts were received by all LPHAs. Variations in the types and amount of responses varied by LPHA, in particularly differences were noted by the size of the health unit. Smaller health units had more challenges to both detect and mount a response to any alerts. LPHAs in the control group were more likely to declare alerts to have public health significance and to initiate any action. Regression models using repeated measures showed an interaction between the year (Year 1 versus Year 2) and the intervention as well as an interaction between year and sustained nature of the alert. Both of these were linked to the control health units reporting more \"watchful waiting\".\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: This study raises questions about the effectiveness of using standardized protocols to improve the performance of syndromic surveillance in a decentralized public health system. Despite efforts to create standardized protocols and engage public health agencies in the process, no significant differences in the effective use of syndromic alerts were observed beyond year 1. It also raises questions about the minimum capacity of the agency and minimum population size that are required for an effective response.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[[\"standardized supports in terms of a standardized aberrant event detection algorithm and a response protocol\", \"pre-existing syndromic surveillance infrastructure and processes\", \"public health responses\", \"no significant difference\", \"LPHAs in the control group were more likely to declare alerts to have public health significance and to initiate any action.

We examine this relationship, among recent immigrants to the US. Given that immigrant parents and children are at greater risk for becoming overweight/obese with increased time in the US, identification of risk factors for weight gain is critical.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Baseline data was collected on 383 mother-child dyads enrolled in Live Well, a community-based, participatory, randomized controlled lifestyle intervention to prevent weight gain in recent immigrant mothers. Socio-demographic information together with heights and weights were collected for both mother and child. Acculturation, behavioral data, and responses to the Caregiver's Feeding Styles Questionnaire (CFSQ) were also obtained from the mother.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The children's average age was 6.2 ± 2.7 years, 58% male. Mothers had been in the country for an average of 6.0 ± 3.3 years, and are Brazilian (36%), Haitian (34%) and Latino (30%). Seventy-two percent of the mothers were overweight/obese, while 43% of the children were overweight/obese. Fifteen percent of mothers reported their feeding style as being high demanding/high responsive; 32% as being high demanding/low responsive; 34% as being low demanding/high responsive and 18% as being low demanding/low responsive. In bivariate analyses, feeding styles significantly differed by child BMIz-score, ethnic group, and mother's perceived stress. In multiple linear regression, a low demanding/high responsive feeding style was found to be positively associated (ß = 0.56) with a higher child weight as compared to high demanding/high responsive, controlling for known covariates (p = 0.01).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Most mothers report having a low demanding/high responsive feeding style, which is associated with higher child weight status in this diverse immigrant population. This finding adds to the growing literature that suggests this type of feeding style may be a risk factor for childhood obesity. Further research is needed to help understand the larger socio-cultural context and its influence on feeding dynamics among immigrant families and families of lower incomes. How parents establish a certain feeding style in their home country compared to when they move to the US \"obesogenic\" environment, should also be explored.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"low demanding/high responsive feeding style\", \"high demanding/high responsive feeding style\", \"child weight\", \"significantly increased\", \"In multiple linear regression, a low demanding/high responsive feeding style was found to be positively associated (\\u00df = 0.56) with a higher child weight as compared to high demanding/high responsive, controlling for known covariates (p = 0.01).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Novel and more efficient preventive strategies are therefore warranted. Abnormal excitability of cortical areas appears to play a pivotal role in migraine pathophysiology. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive and safe technique that is able to durably modulate the activity of the underlying cerebral cortex, and is being tested in various medical indications. The results of small open studies using tDCS in migraine prophylaxis are conflicting, possibly because the optimal stimulation settings and the brain targets were not well chosen. We have previously shown that the cerebral cortex, especially the visual cortex, is hyperresponsive in migraine patients between attacks and provided evidence from evoked potential studies that this is due to a decreased cortical preactivation level. If one accepts this concept, anodal tDCS over the visual cortex may have therapeutic potentials in migraine prevention, as it is able to increase neuronal firing.\n\nABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of anodal tDCS on visual cortex activity in healthy volunteers (HV) and episodic migraine without aura patients (MoA), and its potentials for migraine prevention.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: We recorded pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials (VEP) before and after a 15-min session of anodal tDCS over the visual cortex in 11 HV and 13 MoA interictally. Then 10 MoA patients reporting at least 4 attacks/month subsequently participated in a therapeutic study, and received 2 similar sessions of tDCS per week for 8 weeks as migraine preventive therapy.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: In HV as well as in MoA, anodal tDCS transiently increased habituation of the VEP N1P1 component. VEP amplitudes were not modified by tDCS. Preventive treatment with anodal tDCS turned out to be beneficial in MoA: migraine attack frequency, migraine days, attack duration and acute medication intake significantly decreased during the treatment period compared to pre-treatment baseline (all p < 0.05), and this benefit persisted on average 4.8 weeks after the end of tDCS.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Anodal tDCS over the visual cortex is thus able to increase habituation to repetitive visual stimuli in healthy volunteers and in episodic migraineurs, who on average lack habituation interictally. Moreover, 2 weekly sessions of anodal tDCS had a significant preventive anti- migraine effect, proofing the concept that the low preactivation level of the visual cortex in migraine patients can be corrected by an activating neurostimulation. The therapeutic results indicate that a larger sham-controlled trial using the same tDCS protocol is worthwhile.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)\", \"baseline\", \"acute medication intake\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Preventive treatment with anodal tDCS turned out to be beneficial in MoA: migraine attack frequency, migraine days, attack duration and acute medication intake significantly decreased during the treatment period compared to pre-treatment baseline (all p \\u003c 0.05), and this benefit persisted on average 4.8 weeks after the end of tDCS.\"], [\"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)\", \"baseline\", \"migraine attack frequency, migraine days, attack duration \", \"significantly decreased\", \"Preventive treatment with anodal tDCS turned out to be beneficial in MoA: migraine attack frequency, migraine days, attack duration and acute medication intake significantly decreased during the treatment period compared to pre-treatment baseline (all p \\u003c 0.05),\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:131"}, "target": "[[\"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)\", \"baseline\", \"acute medication intake\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Preventive treatment with anodal tDCS turned out to be beneficial in MoA: migraine attack frequency, migraine days, attack duration and acute medication intake significantly decreased during the treatment period compared to pre-treatment baseline (all p \\u003c 0.05), and this benefit persisted on average 4.8 weeks after the end of tDCS.\"], [\"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)\", \"baseline\", \"migraine attack frequency, migraine days, attack duration \", \"significantly decreased\", \"Preventive treatment with anodal tDCS turned out to be beneficial in MoA: migraine attack frequency, migraine days, attack duration and acute medication intake significantly decreased during the treatment period compared to pre-treatment baseline (all p \\u003c 0.05),\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

Each fat had melting characteristics, plasticity and solids fat content suitable for use as hardstock in margarine and other solid fat formulations.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Thirty human volunteers were fed complete, whole food diets during 4 wk periods, where total fat (~31% daily energy, >70% from the test fats) and fatty acid composition were tightly controlled. A crossover design was used with 3 randomly-assigned diet rotations and repeated-measures analysis. One test fat rotation was based on palm olein (POL) and provided 12.0 percent of energy (%en) as palmitic acid (16:0); a second contained trans-rich partially hydrogenated soybean oil (PHSO) and provided 3.2 %en as trans fatty acids plus 6.5 %en as 16:0, while the third used an interesterified fat (IE) and provided 12.5 %en as stearic acid (18:0). After 4 wk the plasma lipoproteins, fatty acid profile, as well as fasting glucose and insulin were assessed. In addition, after 2 wk into each period an 8 h postprandial challenge was initiated in a subset of 19 subjects who consumed a meal containing 53 g of test fat.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: After 4 wk, both PHSO and IE fats significantly elevated both the LDL/HDL ratio and fasting blood glucose, the latter almost 20% in the IE group relative to POL. Fasting 4 wk insulin was 10% lower after PHSO (p > 0.05) and 22% lower after IE (p < 0.001) compared to POL.

Novel and more efficient preventive strategies are therefore warranted. Abnormal excitability of cortical areas appears to play a pivotal role in migraine pathophysiology. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive and safe technique that is able to durably modulate the activity of the underlying cerebral cortex, and is being tested in various medical indications. The results of small open studies using tDCS in migraine prophylaxis are conflicting, possibly because the optimal stimulation settings and the brain targets were not well chosen. We have previously shown that the cerebral cortex, especially the visual cortex, is hyperresponsive in migraine patients between attacks and provided evidence from evoked potential studies that this is due to a decreased cortical preactivation level. If one accepts this concept, anodal tDCS over the visual cortex may have therapeutic potentials in migraine prevention, as it is able to increase neuronal firing.\n\nABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of anodal tDCS on visual cortex activity in healthy volunteers (HV) and episodic migraine without aura patients (MoA), and its potentials for migraine prevention.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: We recorded pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials (VEP) before and after a 15-min session of anodal tDCS over the visual cortex in 11 HV and 13 MoA interictally. Then 10 MoA patients reporting at least 4 attacks/month subsequently participated in a therapeutic study, and received 2 similar sessions of tDCS per week for 8 weeks as migraine preventive therapy.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: In HV as well as in MoA, anodal tDCS transiently increased habituation of the VEP N1P1 component. VEP amplitudes were not modified by tDCS. Preventive treatment with anodal tDCS turned out to be beneficial in MoA: migraine attack frequency, migraine days, attack duration and acute medication intake significantly decreased during the treatment period compared to pre-treatment baseline (all p < 0.05), and this benefit persisted on average 4.8 weeks after the end of tDCS.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Anodal tDCS over the visual cortex is thus able to increase habituation to repetitive visual stimuli in healthy volunteers and in episodic migraineurs, who on average lack habituation interictally. Moreover, 2 weekly sessions of anodal tDCS had a significant preventive anti- migraine effect, proofing the concept that the low preactivation level of the visual cortex in migraine patients can be corrected by an activating neurostimulation. The therapeutic results indicate that a larger sham-controlled trial using the same tDCS protocol is worthwhile.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"anodal tDCS over the visual cortex\", \"null\", \"migraine attack frequency\", \"significantly decreased\", \"migraine attack frequency, migraine days, attack duration and acute medication intake significantly decreased during the treatment period compared to pre-treatment baseline (all p < 0.05)\"],\n    [\"anodal tDCS over the visual cortex\", \"null\", \"migraine days\", \"significantly decreased\", \"migraine attack frequency, migraine days, attack duration and acute medication intake significantly decreased during the treatment period compared to pre-treatment baseline (all p < 0.05)\"],\n    [\"anodal tDCS over the visual cortex\", \"null\", \"attack duration\", \"significantly decreased\", \"migraine attack frequency, migraine days, attack duration and acute medication intake significantly decreased during the treatment period compared to pre-treatment baseline (all p < 0.05)\"],\n    [\"anodal tDCS over the visual cortex\", \"null\", \"acute medication intake\", \"significantly decreased\", \"migraine attack frequency, migraine days, attack duration and acute medication intake significantly decreased during the treatment period compared to pre-treatment baseline (all p < 0.05)\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"anodal tDCS over the visual cortex\", \"null\", \"migraine attack frequency\", \"significantly decreased\", \"migraine attack frequency, migraine days, attack duration and acute medication intake significantly decreased during the treatment period compared to pre-treatment baseline (all p < 0.05)\"],\n    [\"anodal tDCS over the visual cortex\", \"null\", \"migraine days\", \"significantly decreased\", \"migraine attack frequency, migraine days, attack duration and acute medication intake significantly decreased during the treatment period compared to pre-treatment baseline (all p < 0.05)\"],\n    [\"anodal tDCS over the visual cortex\", \"null\", \"attack duration\", \"significantly decreased\", \"migraine attack frequency, migraine days, attack duration and acute medication intake significantly decreased during the treatment period compared to pre-treatment baseline (all p < 0.05)\"],\n    [\"anodal tDCS over the visual cortex\", \"null\", \"acute medication intake\", \"significantly decreased\", \"migraine attack frequency, migraine days, attack duration and acute medication intake significantly decreased during the treatment period compared to pre-treatment baseline (all p < 0.05)\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "fa79157f057070eab9abf4078eb54137f2a46f9300ce476df838e64dfbb795fb", "prompt_hash": "18ec020a4021aeeb2d072e9bd0e6571e199cfe7e02ff6e78251fffc459e2456e", "target_hash": "35983d91a9571d5404c4e14e568f67402c36e178cf81627783f932501518a487", "bypass": null}

The primary outcome was to compare post operative pain and range of motion (ROM). The secondary outcome was to measure the duration of surgery, blood loss, chair rise test, quadriceps strength, anterior knee pain, Knee Society Score (KSS),WOMAC scores, mechanical leg axis and component alignment.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Patients in the MIS group (3.97 ± 2.16) had significant more pain at 2 weeks than patients in the conventional group (2.77 ± 1.43) p = 0.003. There was no significant difference in any of the other primary outcome parameters. Surgery time was significantly longer (p < 0.001) and there were significantly higher blood loss (p = 0.002) in the MIS group as compared to the conventional group. The difference of the mean mechanical leg alignment between the groups was not statistically significant (–0.43° (95 % CI –1.50 – 0.64); p = 0.43). <p> There was no significant difference of component alignment between the two surgical groups with respect to flexion/extension (p = 0.269), varus/valgus (p = 0.653) or rotational alignment (p = 0.485) of the femur component and varus valgus alignment (p = 0.778) or posterior slope (p = 0.164) of the tibial component.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: There was no advantage of the MIS approach compared to a conventional approach CAS-TKA in any of the primary outcome measurements assessed, however the MIS approach was associated with longer surgical time and greater blood loss.

Recommendations for prehypertension include engaging in regular physical activity. We aimed to assess feasibility and acceptability and collect preliminary outcome data on ChiRunning for people with elevated blood pressure. ChiRunning is a commercially available running program based on the mindful movements of Tai Chi, which is aimed at decreasing injury by both increasing body awareness and modifying running form.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: We enrolled adults with elevated systolic (130–150 mmHg) or diastolic (80–100 mmHg) blood pressure in a 12-week pilot trial. Participants were randomized 2:1:1 to 8 weeks of: 1) intervention—a trainer-led ChiRunning group (n = 10); 2) active control—a trainer-led running group (n = 6); or 3) educational control—a self-directed running group (n = 6) and followed for 4 more weeks. The active control and educational control groups were combined for analysis.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: This study was feasible, meeting recruitment, retention and adherence goals, and acceptable to participants. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly over the study for either the ChiRunning or control groups. Changes in BMI over time were significantly different from zero in the ChiRunning group (p = 0.04) but not in the control group (slope for ChiRunning −0.05 [−0.1 to −0.002] vs. control −0.01 [−0.06 to 0.04], between slope difference, p = 0.22). Self-reported running-related injury (i.e. discomfort leading to a decrease in running) was similar between groups (ChiRunning, 4 [1.2 to 8.4] vs. control, 3 [0.7 to 7.1] injuries per 100 h of running, p = 0.72) although self-reported running-related discomfort (i.e. discomfort that does not lead to changes in running) trended higher in the ChiRunning group (ChiRunning, 10 [5.4 to 16.8] vs. control, 4 [1.5 to 9] reports of discomfort per 100 h of running, p = 0.06).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: ChiRunning appears to be a feasible and acceptable exercise program for people with elevated blood pressure. We did not find that ChiRunning had a significant impact on blood pressure or self reported injury, but did see a positive change in BMI over time.

Previous studies emphasized cellular immune responses; however, current research suggests both cellular and humoral responses are likely required for a successful therapeutic vaccine. Thus, we aimed to understand antibody response and function induced by vaccination of ART-treated HIV-1-infected patients with immune recovery.

Antibody binding levels were determined with a recently developed microarray approach. We also analyzed neutralization efficiency and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). We found that the DNA prime-rAd5 boost vaccine induced a significant cross-clade HIV-specific antibody response, which correlated with antibody neutralization efficiency. However, despite the increase in antibody binding levels, the vaccine did not significantly stimulate neutralization or ADCC responses. This finding was also reflected by a lack of change in total CD4+ cell associated HIV DNA in those who received the vaccine.

This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study assessed the effects of RMD in the colonic transit time (CTT) and defecation characteristics (frequency, stool volume and consistency).\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Sixty-six healthy adult volunteers (32 men) who did not have a daily defecation habit had a 7-day run-in period before the 21-day intervention period with RMD or placebo. CTT and segmental CTT (SCTT) were assessed by a single abdominal X-ray film taken at the end of both periods after radiopaque marker ingestion. Defecation characteristics and intestinal functions were also assessed, which were self-reported by patients. Intragroup comparisons were evaluated by Student's paired t test, Bonferroni test and Chi-square test, while time comparisons by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and time-by-treatment interaction by repeated-measures ANOVA.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Fifty-seven subjects were assessed for CTT (placebo, n = 28; RMD, n = 29). In the RMD group, the total CTT, left SCTT and rectosigmoidal SCTT decreased significantly compared to baseline (p < 0.01 each; −13.3, −4.7, −8.7 h, respectively). Significant differences between groups were observed in total CTT and left SCTT. Significant time-by-treatment interaction was observed in the RMD group for stool volume (p = 0.014), increasing 56 % compared to baseline (p < 0.01), while remained unchanged in the placebo group. Stool consistency was improved only in the RMD group (p < 0.01). No adverse effects related to study products were observed.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: The results show that RMD improved CTT, stool volume, stool consistency and some intestinal functions in a healthy population.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Digestion-resistant maltodextrin\", \"Placebo\", \"Adverse events\", \"no significant difference\", \"No adverse effects related to study products were observed.\"], [\"Digestion-resistant maltodextrin\", \"Placebo\", \"Improvement in faeces consistency \", \"significantly increased\", \"Stool consistency was improved only in the RMD group (p \\u003c 0.01)\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Previous studies emphasized cellular immune responses; however, current research suggests both cellular and humoral responses are likely required for a successful therapeutic vaccine. Thus, we aimed to understand antibody response and function induced by vaccination of ART-treated HIV-1-infected patients with immune recovery. All subjects participated in EraMune 02, an open-label randomized clinical trial of ART intensification followed by a six plasmid DNA prime (envA, envB, envC, gagB, polB, nefB) and rAd5 boost HIV vaccine with matching inserts. Antibody binding levels were determined with a recently developed microarray approach. We also analyzed neutralization efficiency and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). We found that the DNA prime-rAd5 boost vaccine induced a significant cross-clade HIV-specific antibody response, which correlated with antibody neutralization efficiency. However, despite the increase in antibody binding levels, the vaccine did not significantly stimulate neutralization or ADCC responses. This finding was also reflected by a lack of change in total CD4+ cell associated HIV DNA in those who received the vaccine.

Since endogenous melatonin levels are already reduced at preclinical AD stages, it is important to ask whether replenishing the missing hormone would be beneficial in AD and whether any such effects would be related to the presence of sleep disorder in patients.\n\nABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The effects of add-on prolonged-release melatonin (PRM) (2 mg) to standard therapy on cognitive functioning and sleep were investigated in 80 patients (men [50.7%], women [49.3%], average age 75.3 years [range, 52–85 years]) diagnosed with mild to moderate AD, with and without insomnia comorbidity, and receiving standard therapy (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with or without memantine). In this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, patients were treated for 2 weeks with placebo and then randomized (1:1) to receive 2 mg of PRM or placebo nightly for 24 weeks, followed by 2 weeks placebo. The AD Assessment Scale–Cognition (ADAS-Cog), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), Mini–Mental State Examination (MMSE), sleep, as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and a daily sleep diary, and safety parameters were measured.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Patients treated with PRM (24 weeks) had significantly better cognitive performance than those treated with placebo, as measured by the IADL (P=0.004) and MMSE (P=0.044). Mean ADAS-Cog did not differ between the groups. Sleep efficiency, as measured by the PSQI, component 4, was also better with PRM (P=0.017). In the comorbid insomnia (PSQI ≥6) subgroup, PRM treatment resulted in significant and clinically meaningful effects versus the placebo, in mean IADL (P=0.032), MMSE score (+1.5 versus −3 points) (P=0.0177), and sleep efficiency (P=0.04). Median ADAS-Cog values (−3.5 versus +3 points) (P=0.045) were significantly better with PRM. Differences were more significant at longer treatment duration. PRM was well tolerated, with an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Add-on PRM has positive effects on cognitive functioning and sleep maintenance in AD patients compared with placebo, particularly in those with insomnia comorbidity.

The aim of this paper was to study whether Interactive Voice Response (IVR) is a more effective method than a questionnaire sent by post when following up outpatient treatment in child and adolescent psychiatry. Eighty patients were recruited from a child and adolescent psychiatric outpatient unit in Sweden. One parent of each of the patients was randomized to complete the BCFPI follow-up form, using either IVR (n = 40) or postal survey (n = 40) one month after discharge. The response rate for complete answers was 65% in the IVR group and 38% in the postal survey group (p = 0.014). There was less need for reminders in the IVR group (p = 0.000). IVR is a promising and cost-effective method for evaluating evidence-based treatment in child and adolescent psychiatric care.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Interactive Voice Response\", \"Questionnaire sent by post\", \"Need for reminders\", \"significantly decreased\", \"There was less need for reminders in the IVR group (p = 0.000).\"], [\"Interactive Voice Response\", \"Questionnaire sent by post\", \"Responsiveness\", \"significantly increased\", \".

The present studies aimed to demonstrate the added benefit and optimal dosages of the combination product over individual ingredients alone in improving sleep and pain.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Each of the two studies was a two-centre, randomised, double-blind and double-dummy trial. In the first study, subjects were randomised into one of the following treatment arms: NS 440 mg/DPH 50 mg, NS 220 mg/DPH 50 mg, NS 440 mg or DPH 50 mg. In the second study, subjects received either NS 440 mg/DPH 25 mg, NS 440 mg or DPH 50 mg. The co-primary end-points in both studies were wake time after sleep onset (WASO) and sleep latency (SL) measured by actigraphy. Other secondary sleep and pain end-points were also assessed.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The intent-to-treat population included 712 and 267 subjects from studies one and two, respectively. In the first study, only the NS 440 mg/DPH 50 mg combination showed significant improvements in both WASO vs. NS alone (−70.3 min p = 0.0002) and SL vs. DPH alone (25.50 and 41.50 min respectively, p < 0.0001).

We also tested whether the presence or severity of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms, and levels of proinflammatory cytokines, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and other blood markers, would predict or impact treatment response.\n\nABSTRACT.METHOD:: Seventy-nine participants (10 dropouts) not currently taking psychotropic medications with at least moderate scores on self-report mood measures were randomly allocated to receive either a probiotic preparation (containing Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum) or a matched placebo, in a double-blind trial for 8 weeks. Data were analysed as intent-to-treat.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: No significant difference was found between the probiotic and placebo groups on any psychological outcome measure (Cohen's d range = 0.07–0.16) or any blood-based biomarker. At end-point, 9 (23%) of those in the probiotic group showed a ⩾60% change on the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (responders), compared to 10 (26%) of those in the placebo group (χ12=0.107, p = ns). Baseline vitamin D level was found to moderate treatment effect on several outcome measures. Dry mouth and sleep disruption were reported more frequently in the placebo group.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:: This study found no evidence that the probiotic formulation is effective in treating low mood, or in moderating the levels of inflammatory and other biomarkers. The lack of observed effect on mood symptoms may be due to the severity, chronicity or treatment resistance of the sample; recruiting an antidepressant-naive sample experiencing mild, acute symptoms of low mood, may well yield a different result. Future studies taking a preventative approach or using probiotics as an adjuvant treatment may also be more effective. Vitamin D levels should be monitored in future studies in the area.

The present studies aimed to demonstrate the added benefit and optimal dosages of the combination product over individual ingredients alone in improving sleep and pain.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Each of the two studies was a two-centre, randomised, double-blind and double-dummy trial. In the first study, subjects were randomised into one of the following treatment arms: NS 440 mg/DPH 50 mg, NS 220 mg/DPH 50 mg, NS 440 mg or DPH 50 mg. In the second study, subjects received either NS 440 mg/DPH 25 mg, NS 440 mg or DPH 50 mg. The co-primary end-points in both studies were wake time after sleep onset (WASO) and sleep latency (SL) measured by actigraphy. Other secondary sleep and pain end-points were also assessed.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The intent-to-treat population included 712 and 267 subjects from studies one and two, respectively.

Furthermore, treatment with insulin in this group is frequently complicated by hypoglycaemia. In healthy patients and those with type 2 diabetes, exogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) decreases blood glucose by suppressing glucagon, stimulating insulin and slowing gastric emptying. Because the former effects are glucose-dependent, the use of GLP-1 is not associated with hypoglycaemia. The objective of this study was to establish if exogenous GLP-1 attenuates the glycaemic response to enteral nutrition in patients with critical illness induced hyperglycaemia.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Seven mechanically ventilated critically ill patients, not previously known to have diabetes, received two intravenous infusions of GLP-1 (1.2 pmol/kg/min) and placebo (4% albumin) over 270 minutes. Infusions were administered on consecutive days in a randomised, double-blind fashion. On both days a mixed nutrient liquid was infused, via a post-pyloric feeding catheter, at a rate of 1.5 kcal/min between 30 and 270 minutes. Blood glucose and plasma GLP-1, insulin and glucagon concentrations were measured.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: In all patients, exogenous GLP-1 infusion reduced the overall glycaemic response during enteral nutrient stimulation (AUC30–270 min GLP-1 (2077 ± 144 mmol/l min) vs placebo (2568 ± 208 mmol/l min); P = 0.02) and the peak blood glucose (GLP-1 (10.1 ± 0.7 mmol/l) vs placebo (12.7 ± 1.0 mmol/l); P < 0.01). The insulin/glucose ratio at 270 minutes was increased with GLP-1 infusion (GLP-1 (9.1 ± 2.7) vs. placebo (5.8 ± 1.8); P = 0.02) but there was no difference in absolute insulin concentrations. There was a transient, non-sustained, reduction in plasma glucagon concentrations during GLP-1 infusion (t = 30 minutes GLP-1 (90 ± 12 pmol/ml) vs. placebo (104 ± 10 pmol/ml); P < 0.01).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Acute, exogenous GLP-1 infusion markedly attenuates the glycaemic response to enteral nutrition in the critically ill. These observations suggest that GLP-1 and/or its analogues have the potential to manage hyperglycaemia in the critically ill.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry number: ACTRN12609000093280.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"Exogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 infusion\", \"Control\", \"Peak blood glucose\", \"significantly decreased\", \"In all patients, exogenous GLP-1 infusion reduced the overall glycaemic response during enteral nutrient stimulation (AUC30\\u2013270 min GLP-1 (2077 \\u00b1 144 mmol/l min) vs placebo (2568 \\u00b1 208 mmol/l min); P = 0.02) and the peak blood glucose (GLP-1 (10.1 \\u00b1 0.7 mmol/l) vs placebo (12.7 \\u00b1 1.0 mmol/l); P \\u003c 0.01).\"], [\"Exogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 infusion\", \"Control\", \"Absolute insulin concentrations\", \"no significant difference\", \"The insulin/glucose ratio at 270 minutes was increased with GLP-1 infusion (GLP-1 (9.1 \\u00b1 2.7) vs. placebo (5.8 \\u00b1 1.8); P = 0.02) but there was no difference in absolute insulin concentrations.\"], [\"Exogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 infusion\", \"Control\", \"Glucagon concentrations during infusion\", \"significantly decreased\", \"There was a transient, non-sustained, reduction in plasma glucagon concentrations during GLP-1 infusion (t = 30 minutes GLP-1 (90 \\u00b1 12 pmol/ml) vs. placebo (104 \\u00b1 10 pmol/ml); P \\u003c 0.01).\"], [\"Exogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 infusion\", \"Control\", \"Glycaemic response\", \"significantly decreased\", \"In all patients, exogenous GLP-1 infusion reduced the overall glycaemic response during enteral nutrient stimulation (AUC30\\u2013270 min GLP-1 (2077 \\u00b1 144 mmol/l min) vs placebo (2568 \\u00b1 208 mmol/l min); P = 0.02) and the peak blood glucose (GLP-1 (10.1 \\u00b1 0.7 mmol/l) vs placebo (12.7 \\u00b1 1.0 mmol/l); P \\u003c 0.01).\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:136"}, "target": "[[\"Exogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 infusion\", \"Control\", \"Peak blood glucose\", \"significantly decreased\", \"In all patients, exogenous GLP-1 infusion reduced the overall glycaemic response during enteral nutrient stimulation (AUC30\\u2013270 min GLP-1 (2077 \\u00b1 144 mmol/l min) vs placebo (2568 \\u00b1 208 mmol/l min); P = 0.02) and the peak blood glucose (GLP-1 (10.1 \\u00b1 0.7 mmol/l) vs placebo (12.7 \\u00b1 1.0 mmol/l); P \\u003c 0.01).\"], [\"Exogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 infusion\", \"Control\", \"Absolute insulin concentrations\", \"no significant difference\", \"The insulin/glucose ratio at 270 minutes was increased with GLP-1 infusion (GLP-1 (9.1 \\u00b1 2.7) vs. placebo (5.8 \\u00b1 1.8); P = 0.02) but there was no difference in absolute insulin concentrations.\"], [\"Exogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 infusion\", \"Control\", \"Glucagon concentrations during infusion\", \"significantly decreased\", \"There was a transient, non-sustained, reduction in plasma glucagon concentrations during GLP-1 infusion (t = 30 minutes GLP-1 (90 \\u00b1 12 pmol/ml) vs. placebo (104 \\u00b1 10 pmol/ml); P \\u003c 0.01).\"], [\"Exogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 infusion\", \"Control\", \"Glycaemic response\", \"significantly decreased\", \"In all patients, exogenous GLP-1 infusion reduced the overall glycaemic response during enteral nutrient stimulation (AUC30\\u2013270 min GLP-1 (2077 \\u00b1 144 mmol/l min) vs placebo (2568 \\u00b1 208 mmol/l min); P = 0.02) and the peak blood glucose (GLP-1 (10.1 \\u00b1 0.7 mmol/l) vs placebo (12.7 \\u00b1 1.0 mmol/l); P \\u003c 0.01).\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

From the viewpoint of long-term continuity of activity, it is necessary to develop various cognitive stimulating programs. The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a cognitive intervention through a training program for picture book reading for community-dwelling older adults.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Fifty-eight Japanese older participants were divided into the intervention and control groups using simple randomization (n =29 vs 29). In the intervention group, participants took part in a program aimed at learning and mastering methods of picture book reading as a form of cognitive training intervention. The control group listened to lectures about elderly health maintenance. Cognitive tests were conducted individually before and after the programs.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The rate of memory retention, computed by dividing Logical Memory delayed recall by immediate recall, showed a significant interaction (p < .05) in analysis of covariance. Simple main effects showed that the rate of memory retention of the intervention group improved after the program completion (p < .05). In the participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) examined by Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-J) (n =14 vs 15), significant interactions were seen in Trail Making Test-A (p < .01), Trail Making Test-B (p < .05), Kana pick-out test (p < .05) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (p < .05).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: The intervention effect was found in delayed verbal memory. This program is also effective for improving attention and executive function in those with MCI. The short-term interventional findings suggest that this program might contribute to preventing a decline in memory and executive function.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN-CTR: UMIN000014712 (Date of ICMJE and WHO compliant trial information disclosure: 30 July 2014)\n\nFindings:\n[[\"cognitive intervention through a training program for picture book reading for In the participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)\", \"control group\", \"rate of retention\", \"significantly increased\", \"The rate of memory retention, computed by dividing Logical Memory delayed recall by immediate recall, showed a significant interaction (p \\u003c .05) in analysis of covariance.\"], [\"cognitive intervention through a training program for picture book reading for In the participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)\", \"control group\", \"rate of retention\", \"significantly increased\", \"Simple main effects showed that the rate of memory retention of the intervention group improved after the program completion (p \\u003c .05).\"], [\"cognitive intervention through a training program for picture book reading for community-dwelling older adults.\", \"control group\", \"the rate of memory retention\", \"significantly increased\", \"Simple main effects showed that the rate of memory retention of the intervention group improved after the program completion (p \\u003c .05).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Because the former effects are glucose-dependent, the use of GLP-1 is not associated with hypoglycaemia. The objective of this study was to establish if exogenous GLP-1 attenuates the glycaemic response to enteral nutrition in patients with critical illness induced hyperglycaemia.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Seven mechanically ventilated critically ill patients, not previously known to have diabetes, received two intravenous infusions of GLP-1 (1.2 pmol/kg/min) and placebo (4% albumin) over 270 minutes. Infusions were administered on consecutive days in a randomised, double-blind fashion. On both days a mixed nutrient liquid was infused, via a post-pyloric feeding catheter, at a rate of 1.5 kcal/min between 30 and 270 minutes. Blood glucose and plasma GLP-1, insulin and glucagon concentrations were measured.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: In all patients, exogenous GLP-1 infusion reduced the overall glycaemic response during enteral nutrient stimulation (AUC30–270 min GLP-1 (2077 ± 144 mmol/l min) vs placebo (2568 ± 208 mmol/l min); P = 0.02) and the peak blood glucose (GLP-1 (10.1 ± 0.7 mmol/l) vs placebo (12.7 ± 1.0 mmol/l); P < 0.01). The insulin/glucose ratio at 270 minutes was increased with GLP-1 infusion (GLP-1 (9.1 ± 2.7) vs. placebo (5.8 ± 1.8); P = 0.02) but there was no difference in absolute insulin concentrations. There was a transient, non-sustained, reduction in plasma glucagon concentrations during GLP-1 infusion (t = 30 minutes GLP-1 (90 ± 12 pmol/ml) vs. placebo (104 ± 10 pmol/ml); P < 0.01).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Acute, exogenous GLP-1 infusion markedly attenuates the glycaemic response to enteral nutrition in the critically ill. These observations suggest that GLP-1 and/or its analogues have the potential to manage hyperglycaemia in the critically ill.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry number: ACTRN12609000093280.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"exogenous GLP-1 infusion\", \"placebo\", \"overall glycaemic response during enteral nutrient stimulation\", \"significantly decreased\", \"In all patients, exogenous GLP-1 infusion reduced the overall glycaemic response during enteral nutrient stimulation (AUC30–270 min GLP-1 (2077 ± 144 mmol/l min) vs placebo (2568 ± 208 mmol/l min); P = 0.02)\"],\n    [\"exogenous GLP-1 infusion\", \"placebo\", \"peak blood glucose\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The peak blood glucose was lower with GLP-1 infusion (GLP-1 (10.1 ± 0.7 mmol/l) vs placebo (12.7 ± 1.0 mmol/l); P < 0.01).\"],\n    [\"exogenous GLP-1 infusion\", \"placebo\", \"insulin/glucose ratio at 270 minutes\", \"significantly increased\", \"The insulin/glucose ratio at 270 minutes was increased with GLP-1 infusion (GLP-1 (9.1 ± 2.7) vs. placebo (5.8 ± 1.8); P = 0.02)\"],\n    [\"exogenous GLP-1 infusion\", \"placebo\", \"plasma glucagon concentrations\", \"significantly decreased\", \"There was a transient, non-sustained, reduction in plasma glucagon concentrations during GLP-1 infusion (t = 30 minutes GLP-1 (90 ± 12 pmol/ml) vs. placebo (104 ± 10 pmol/ml); P < 0.01).\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"exogenous GLP-1 infusion\", \"placebo\", \"overall glycaemic response during enteral nutrient stimulation\", \"significantly decreased\", \"In all patients, exogenous GLP-1 infusion reduced the overall glycaemic response during enteral nutrient stimulation (AUC30–270 min GLP-1 (2077 ± 144 mmol/l min) vs placebo (2568 ± 208 mmol/l min); P = 0.02)\"],\n    [\"exogenous GLP-1 infusion\", \"placebo\", \"peak blood glucose\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The peak blood glucose was lower with GLP-1 infusion (GLP-1 (10.1 ± 0.7 mmol/l) vs placebo (12.7 ± 1.0 mmol/l); P < 0.01).\"],\n    [\"exogenous GLP-1 infusion\", \"placebo\", \"insulin/glucose ratio at 270 minutes\", \"significantly increased\", \"The insulin/glucose ratio at 270 minutes was increased with GLP-1 infusion (GLP-1 (9.1 ± 2.7) vs. placebo (5.8 ± 1.8); P = 0.02)\"],\n    [\"exogenous GLP-1 infusion\", \"placebo\", \"plasma glucagon concentrations\", \"significantly decreased\", \"There was a transient, non-sustained, reduction in plasma glucagon concentrations during GLP-1 infusion (t = 30 minutes GLP-1 (90 ± 12 pmol/ml) vs. placebo (104 ± 10 pmol/ml); P < 0.01).\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "7383094ac4c2e7dce055afce0f28ef8e1d9847e9aadc6e3509065726c5ea7f16", "prompt_hash": "1010fdad3d0949343cf388a6904af60c4540f5f7db57a20a76db6294b083ba1e", "target_hash": "c653e5f5008e172a2e6e74b424b7f7d70778f4165dff1e5584ecc857be4d5937", "bypass": null}

Outpatient IOL is an attractive option to reduce these impacts. To date there is little data comparing outpatient and inpatient IOL methods, and potential safety concerns (hyperstimulation) if prostaglandins, the standard inpatient IOL medications, are used in the outpatient setting. The purpose of this study was to assess feasibility, clinical effectiveness and patient acceptability of outpatient Foley catheter (OPC) vs. inpatient vaginal PGE2 (IP) for induction of labour (IOL) at term.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Women with an unfavourable cervix requiring IOL at term (N = 101) were randomised to outpatient care using Foley catheter (OPC, n = 50) or inpatient care using vaginal PGE2 (IP, n = 51). OPC group had Foley catheter inserted and were discharged overnight following a reassuring cardiotocograph. IP group received 2 mg/1 mg vaginal PGE2 if nulliparous or 1 mg/1 mg if multiparous. Main outcome measures were inpatient stay (prior to birth, in Birthing Unit, total), mode of birth, induction to delivery interval, adverse reactions and patient satisfaction.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: OPC group had shorter hospital stay prior to birth (21.3 vs. 32.4 hrs, p < .001), IP were more likely to achieve vaginal birth within 12 hours of presenting to Birthing Unit (53% vs. 28%, p = .01). Vaginal birth rates (66% OPC Vs. 71% IP), total induction to delivery time (33.5 hrs vs. 31.3 hrs) and total inpatient times (96 hrs OPC Vs. 105 hrs IP) were similar.

We investigated the effect of statin treatment (targeted to achieve guideline goals) on CVD outcomes in different age groups to determine whether statins are more beneficial in the elderly.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The primary endpoint of this post hoc analysis of the GREek Atorvastatin and Coronary-heart-disease Evaluation (GREACE) study (n = 1,600 patients with established coronary heart disease (CHD), mean follow-up 3 years) was the absolute and relative CVD event (a composite of death, myocardial infarction, revascularization, unstable angina, heart failure and stroke) risk reduction in age quartiles (each n = 200). Patients on \"structured care\" with atorvastatin (n = 800) followed up by the university clinic and treated to lipid goal were compared with the corresponding quartiles on \"usual care\" (n = 800) followed up by specialists or general practitioners of the patient's choice outside the hospital.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: In the elderly (mean age 69 ±4 and 70 ±3 years in the \"structured\" and \"usual care\", respectively) the absolute CVD event reduction between \"structured\" and \"usual care\" was 16.5% (p < 0.0001), while in the younger patients (mean age 51 ±3 years and 52 ±3 years in the \"structured\" and \"usual care\", respectively) this was 8.5% (p = 0.016); relative risk reduction (RRR) 60% (p < 0.0001) vs. 42% respectively (p = 0.001). The elderly had higher rates of chronic kidney disease and higher uric acid levels, plus an increased prevalence of diabetes, metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. These factors might contribute to the increased CVD risk in older patients.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: All age groups benefited from statin treatment, but the elderly on \"structured care\" had a greater absolute and relative CVD risk reduction than the younger patients when compared with the corresponding patients assigned to \"usual care\". These findings suggest that we should not deprive older patients of CVD prevention treatment and lipid target achievement.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"\\u201cstructured care\\u201d with atorvastatin\", \"usual care\", \"absolute cardiovascular disease (CVD) event reduction\", \"significantly increased\", \"In the elderly (mean age 69 \\u00b14 and 70 \\u00b13 years in the \\u201cstructured\\u201d and \\u201cusual care\\u201d, respectively) the absolute CVD event reduction between \\u201cstructured\\u201d and \\u201cusual care\\u201d was 16.5% (p \\u003c 0.0001), while in the younger patients (mean age 51 \\u00b13 years and 52 \\u00b13 years in the \\u201cstructured\\u201d and \\u201cusual care\\u201d, respectively) this was 8.5% (p = 0.016)\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

To investigate how this alarming development can be counteracted, we conducted a randomized controlled trial evaluating a job coaching intervention to maintain the working capacity of members of staff and ultimately prevent sickness absence. Our sample included N = 99 employees who reported mental distress due to work-related problems. The intervention group (n = 58) received between 8 and 12 individual job coaching sessions in which they worked with a professional job coach to reduce their mental distress. The control group (n = 41) received a brochure about mental distress. Data were collected before the start of the study, at the end of the job coaching intervention, and at a 3-month follow-up. These data included the number of sickness absence days as the primary outcome and questionnaire measures to assess burnout indicators, life satisfaction, and work-related experiences and behaviors. Compared with the control group, the results indicated no reduction in sickness absence in the intervention group but fewer depressive symptoms, a heightened ability of the participants to distance themselves from work, more experience of work-related success, less depletion of emotional resources, and a greater satisfaction with life when participants had received the job coaching. Thus, although we could not detect a reduction in sickness absence between the groups, job coaching was shown to be a viable intervention technique to benefit employees by contributing to re-establish their mental health. We discuss the implications of the study and outline future research.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"Job coaching sessions\", \"Control\", \"Sickness absence\", \"no significant difference\", \"Compared with the control group, the results indicated no reduction in sickness absence in the intervention group\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:138"}, "target": "[[\"Job coaching sessions\", \"Control\", \"Sickness absence\", \"no significant difference\", \"Compared with the control group, the results indicated no reduction in sickness absence in the intervention group\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

This difference was entirely attributable to a difference between the two measures during the nocturnal period. Nocturnal gastric acid breakthrough was not a useful predictor of pathologic nocturnal esophageal reflux.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: In GERD subjects treated with a PPI, measuring time esophageal pH < 4 will significantly overestimate the prevalence of pathologic esophageal acid exposure over 24 hours and during the nocturnal period.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"integrated acidity\", \"time pH \\u003c 4\", \"the prevalence of pathologic 24-hour esophageal reflux\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The prevalence of pathologic 24-hour esophageal reflux in both studies was significantly higher when measured as time pH \\u003c 4 than when measured as integrated acidity\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

To investigate how this alarming development can be counteracted, we conducted a randomized controlled trial evaluating a job coaching intervention to maintain the working capacity of members of staff and ultimately prevent sickness absence. Our sample included N = 99 employees who reported mental distress due to work-related problems. The intervention group (n = 58) received between 8 and 12 individual job coaching sessions in which they worked with a professional job coach to reduce their mental distress. The control group (n = 41) received a brochure about mental distress. Data were collected before the start of the study, at the end of the job coaching intervention, and at a 3-month follow-up. These data included the number of sickness absence days as the primary outcome and questionnaire measures to assess burnout indicators, life satisfaction, and work-related experiences and behaviors. Compared with the control group, the results indicated no reduction in sickness absence in the intervention group but fewer depressive symptoms, a heightened ability of the participants to distance themselves from work, more experience of work-related success, less depletion of emotional resources, and a greater satisfaction with life when participants had received the job coaching. Thus, although we could not detect a reduction in sickness absence between the groups, job coaching was shown to be a viable intervention technique to benefit employees by contributing to re-establish their mental health. We discuss the implications of the study and outline future research.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[[\"job coaching\", \"a brochure about mental distress\", \"number of sickness absence days\", \"no significant difference\", \"Compared with the control group, the results indicated no reduction in sickness absence in the intervention group\"], [\"job coaching\", \"a brochure about mental distress\", \"depressive symptoms\", \"significantly decreased\", \"fewer depressive symptoms\"], [\"job coaching\", \"a brochure about mental distress\", \"ability to distance oneself from work\", \"significantly increased\", \"a heightened ability of the participants to distance themselves from work\"], [\"job coaching\", \"a brochure about mental distress\", \"work-related success\", \"significantly increased\", \"more experience of work-related success\"], [\"job coaching\", \"a brochure about mental distress\", \"emotional resource depletion\", \"significantly decreased\", \"less depletion of emotional resources\"], [\"job coaching\", \"a brochure about mental distress\", \"life satisfaction\", \"significantly increased\", \"a greater satisfaction with life\"]]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[[\"job coaching\", \"a brochure about mental distress\", \"number of sickness absence days\", \"no significant difference\", \"Compared with the control group, the results indicated no reduction in sickness absence in the intervention group\"], [\"job coaching\", \"a brochure about mental distress\", \"depressive symptoms\", \"significantly decreased\", \"fewer depressive symptoms\"], [\"job coaching\", \"a brochure about mental distress\", \"ability to distance oneself from work\", \"significantly increased\", \"a heightened ability of the participants to distance themselves from work\"], [\"job coaching\", \"a brochure about mental distress\", \"work-related success\", \"significantly increased\", \"more experience of work-related success\"], [\"job coaching\", \"a brochure about mental distress\", \"emotional resource depletion\", \"significantly decreased\", \"less depletion of emotional resources\"], [\"job coaching\", \"a brochure about mental distress\", \"life satisfaction\", \"significantly increased\", \"a greater satisfaction with life\"]]"], "doc_hash": "ead34d8744c9b1a514895f6d47df92965499ccd56401af67073789df7713c8d9", "prompt_hash": "0683d8989f838dd0568bf7161423642cb7556779b2fa5a425ca761b2cb8dc6b0", "target_hash": "ad386babea00cb5260bf3960f560270dca340ba836108560bfa6a2153617afa7", "bypass": null}

This study aimed to determine the effects of dietary MH, delivered as an extract of un-ripened avocado, on energy expenditure (EE) in healthy adult Labrador Retriever dogs (total of 12 dogs, 26.99 ± 0.634 kg, 4.9 ± 0.2 y). The study was a double-blind, cross-over with each dog receiving both dietary treatments, control (CON) and MH (400 mg/kg of diet; 6 mg/kg BW), in random order. Resting and post-prandial (10 h) EE and respiratory quotient (RQ) were determined by indirect calorimetry (d 42). The following day, body composition was assessed using dual X-ray absorptiometry. Continuous activity monitoring was conducted using an Atical® accelerometer (d 43–47). A vastus lateralis muscle biopsy was obtained prior to the morning meal (d 49) and 4 h after consumption of their meal (d 56) to determine the protein content and phosphorylation of 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Diet did not affect body weight, resting EE or skeletal muscle AMPK phosphorylation. Dogs fed MH had significantly lower post-prandial RQ (p = 0.02) and ratio of fat to lean body mass (p = 0.02). Physical activity during light time periods (but not dark) was lower in dogs fed MH (p < 0.05) during weekends, but not on weekdays. These results suggest that MH affects energy balance of adult dogs, but that these effects are not dose dependent and not due to physical activity.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"Mannoheptulose\", \"Control\", \"Body weight\", \"no significant difference\", \"Diet did not affect body weight, resting EE or skeletal muscle AMPK phosphorylation.\"], [\"Mannoheptulose\", \"Control\", \"Resting energy expenditure\", \"no significant difference\", \"Diet did not affect body weight, resting EE or skeletal muscle AMPK phosphorylation.\"], [\"Mannoheptulose\", \"Control\", \"Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase phosphorylation\", \"no significant difference\", \"Diet did not affect body weight, resting EE or skeletal muscle AMPK phosphorylation.\"], [\"Mannoheptulose\", \"Control\", \"Ratio of fat to lean body mass\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Dogs fed MH had significantly lower post-prandial RQ (p = 0.02) and ratio of fat to lean body mass (p = 0.02).\"], [\"Mannoheptulose\", \"Control\", \"Post-prandial respiratory quotient\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Dogs fed MH had significantly lower post-prandial RQ (p = 0.02) and ratio of fat to lean body mass (p = 0.02).\"], [\"Mannoheptulose\", \"Control\", \"Physical activity during light time periods\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Physical activity during light time periods (but not dark) was lower in dogs fed MH (p \\u003c 0.05) during weekends, but not on weekdays.\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:139"}, "target": "[[\"Mannoheptulose\", \"Control\", \"Body weight\", \"no significant difference\", \"Diet did not affect body weight, resting EE or skeletal muscle AMPK phosphorylation.\"], [\"Mannoheptulose\", \"Control\", \"Resting energy expenditure\", \"no significant difference\", \"Diet did not affect body weight, resting EE or skeletal muscle AMPK phosphorylation.\"], [\"Mannoheptulose\", \"Control\", \"Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase phosphorylation\", \"no significant difference\", \"Diet did not affect body weight, resting EE or skeletal muscle AMPK phosphorylation.\"], [\"Mannoheptulose\", \"Control\", \"Ratio of fat to lean body mass\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Dogs fed MH had significantly lower post-prandial RQ (p = 0.02) and ratio of fat to lean body mass (p = 0.02).\"], [\"Mannoheptulose\", \"Control\", \"Post-prandial respiratory quotient\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Dogs fed MH had significantly lower post-prandial RQ (p = 0.02) and ratio of fat to lean body mass (p = 0.02).\"], [\"Mannoheptulose\", \"Control\", \"Physical activity during light time periods\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Physical activity during light time periods (but not dark) was lower in dogs fed MH (p \\u003c 0.05) during weekends, but not on weekdays.\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

Each patient was randomly assigned to undergo a tubal resection either after Pomeroy ligation (n=54) or after bipolar coagulation with Kleppinger forceps (n=55). Postoperative pain, as assessed using a 10-point visual analog scale, was the primary comparison endpoint.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: No technical difficulties with either technique required conversion to a minilaparotomy. The mean time to remove both tubal segments was not different between techniques (7 minutes, 21 seconds; range, 4 minutes, 25 seconds to 15 minutes, 43 seconds). Each segment (mean, 1.6 cm; range, 0.8 to 3.5 cm) was confirmed in the operating room, then histologically. Postoperative pain at 6 hours was scored similarly (median, ligation 4.6, coagulation 4.0 of 10). Outpatient recovery was the same, unless pelvic pain required overnight observation (ligation, 4 patients; coagulation, 2 patients).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: Partial salpingectomy, using microlaparos-copy with either bipolar coagulation or loop ligation, was performed with comparable ease, confirmation of the removed tube, and similar postoperative discomfort.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"undergo a tubal resection after Pomeroy ligation\", \"undergo a tubal resection after bipolar coagulation with Kleppinger forceps\", \"The mean time to remove both tubal segments\", \"no significant difference\", \"The mean time to remove both tubal segments was not different between techniques (7 minutes, 21 seconds; range, 4 minutes, 25 seconds to 15 minutes, 43 seconds).\"], [\"undergo a tubal resection after Pomeroy ligation\", \"undergo a tubal resection after bipolar coagulation with Kleppinger forceps\", \"Postoperative pain at 6 hours\", \"no significant difference\", \"Postoperative pain at 6 hours was scored similarly (median, ligation 4.6, coagulation 4.0 of 10)\"], [\"undergo a tubal resection after Pomeroy ligation\", \"undergo a tubal resection after bipolar coagulation with Kleppinger forceps\", \"Outpatient recovery\", \"no significant difference\", \"Outpatient recovery was the same, unless pelvic pain required overnight observation (ligation, 4 patients; coagulation, 2 patients).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

It is a soft tissue disorder that causes significant disability and pain. <p> The aim of the study was to establish that an intramuscular steroid injection is effective in the short-term pain relief and functional improvement of tennis elbow. The severity of pain at the injection site was monitored to determine whether the intramuscular injection is better tolerated than the intralesional injection.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS AND RESULTS: 19 patients, who had no treatment for tennis elbow in the preceding 3 months, were recruited from Whipps Cross University Hospital, London, and were randomised to receive either 80 mg of intramuscular Depo-Medrone or 40 mg of intralesional Depo-Medrone injection. Blinding proved difficult as the injection sites differed and placebo arms were not included in the study. A Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) Questionnaire and a 10-point Likert scale were used to assess primary outcome. Six weeks after the treatment, there was a reduction in pain, improvement in function and total PRTEE scores in both intramuscular and intralesional groups (p=0.008) using a 95% CI for mean treatment difference of −26 to +16 points. A statistically significant result (p=0.001) in favour of intramuscular causing less pain at the injection site was noted.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Non-inferiority of intramuscular to intralesional injections was not confirmed; however, the intramuscular injection proved to be effective in reducing tennis elbow-related symptoms and was found less painful at the site of injection at the time of administration.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: EUDRACT Number: 2010-022131-11. <p> REC Number: 10/H0718/76 (NRES, Central London REC 1).\n\nFindings:\n[[\"80\\u2009mg of intramuscular Depo-Medrone\", \"40\\u2009mg of intralesional Depo-Medrone\", \"pain at the injection site\", \"significantly decreased\", \"A statistically significant result (p=0.001) in favour of intramuscular causing less pain at the injection site was noted.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

As a consequence, this might lead to a higher intake of energy-dense snacks and less fruit and vegetables, a habit that increases the risk of developing chronic diseases. The aim of this experimental study is to examine whether playing a memory game with fruit affects fruit intake among young children. We used a randomized between-subject design with 127 children (age: 7–12 y) who played a memory-game, containing either fruit (n = 64) or non-food products (n = 63). While playing the memory-game in a separate room in school during school hours, free intake of fruit (mandarins, apples, bananas, and grapes) was measured. Afterwards, the children completed self-report measures, and length and weight were assessed. The main finding is that playing a memory-game containing fruit increases overall fruit intake (P = 0.016). Children who played the fruit version of the memory-game ate more bananas (P = 0.015) and mandarins (P = 0.036) than children who played the non-food memory-game; no effects were found for apples (P > 0.05) and grapes (P > 0.05). The findings suggest that playing a memory-game with fruit stimulates fruit intake among young children. This is an important finding because children eat insufficient fruit, according to international standards, and more traditional health interventions have limited success.

A feasibility and acceptability study was designed for a residential aged care (RAC) facility, based on the Gold Coast, Australia. Thirty-seven adults, mean age 86.8 ± 6.1 years (30 females) living in a RAC facility. Participants were allocated into an exercise (n = 20) or control (n = 17) group. The exercise group, the Group Aged Care Exercise (GrACE) programme, performed 12 weeks of twice weekly resistance exercises. Feasibility was measured via recruitment rate, measurement (physiological and surveys) completion rate, loss-to-follow-up, exercise session adherence, adverse events, and ratings of burden and acceptability. Muscle function was assessed using gait speed, sit-to-stand and handgrip strength assessments. All intervention participants completed pre- and post-assessments, and the exercise intervention, with 85% (n = 17) of the group attending ≥ 18 of the 24 sessions and 15% (n = 3) attending all sessions. Acceptability was 100% with exercise participants, and staff who had been involved with the programme strongly agreed that the participants \"Benefited from the programme.\" There were no adverse events reported by any participants during the exercise sessions. When compared to the control group, the exercise group experienced significant improvements in gait speed (F(4.078) = 8.265, p = 0.007), sit to stand performance (F(3.24) = 11.033, p = 0.002) and handgrip strength (F(3.697) = 26.359, p < 0.001).

Healthy eating habits of children maintain when they become adults, making it important to stimulate fruit intake among children in an enjoyable way. <p> Trial registration: Nederlands Trial Register TC = 5687\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"Playing a memory-game containing fruit\", \"Playing a memory-game with non-food products\", \"Overall fruit intake\", \"significantly increased\", \"Children who played the fruit version of the memory-game ate more bananas (P = 0.015) and mandarins (P = 0.036) than children who played the non-food memory-game; no effects were found for apples (P > 0.05) and grapes (P > 0.05).\"],\n    [\"Playing a memory-game containing fruit\", \"Playing a memory-game with non-food products\", \"Bananas intake\", \"significantly increased\", \"Children who played the fruit version of the memory-game ate more bananas (P = 0.015) than children who played the non-food memory-game.\"],\n    [\"Playing a memory-game containing fruit\", \"Playing a memory-game with non-food products\", \"Mandarins intake\", \"significantly increased\", \"Children who played the fruit version of the memory-game ate more mandarins (P = 0.036) than children who played the non-food memory-game.\"],\n    [null, null, \"Apples and grapes intake\", \"no significant difference\", \"No effects were found for apples (P > 0.05) and grapes (P > 0.05).\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"Playing a memory-game containing fruit\", \"Playing a memory-game with non-food products\", \"Overall fruit intake\", \"significantly increased\", \"Children who played the fruit version of the memory-game ate more bananas (P = 0.015) and mandarins (P = 0.036) than children who played the non-food memory-game; no effects were found for apples (P > 0.05) and grapes (P > 0.05).\"],\n    [\"Playing a memory-game containing fruit\", \"Playing a memory-game with non-food products\", \"Bananas intake\", \"significantly increased\", \"Children who played the fruit version of the memory-game ate more bananas (P = 0.015) than children who played the non-food memory-game.\"],\n    [\"Playing a memory-game containing fruit\", \"Playing a memory-game with non-food products\", \"Mandarins intake\", \"significantly increased\", \"Children who played the fruit version of the memory-game ate more mandarins (P = 0.036) than children who played the non-food memory-game.\"],\n    [null, null, \"Apples and grapes intake\", \"no significant difference\", \"No effects were found for apples (P > 0.05) and grapes (P > 0.05).\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "7c208895f0a25033782c556ea6258d2c0aec6608d2cb442a78ce092e822f155b", "prompt_hash": "bea77be8e9c9bafaf7309191e4dcc4cac1fde3cf8fdbed299a036f6c87722d8f", "target_hash": "0e17881b77b70b5c69c81a0583324dfa265588fa898819b60e6d908950723818", "bypass": null}

The present intervention study evaluated the effect in subjects over 60-yr-old. The vitamin K group (vitamin K + vitamin D + calcium supplement; 15 mg of vitamin K2 [menatetrenone] three times daily, 400 IU of vitamin D once a day, and 315 mg of calcium twice daily) and the control group (vitamin D + calcium supplement) were randomly assigned. During the six months of treatment, seventy eight women participated (38 in the vitamin K group and 40 in the control group) and 45 women completed the study. The baseline characteristics of study participants did not differ between the vitamin K and the control groups. In a per protocol analysis after 6 months, L3 bone mineral density has increased statistically significantly in the vitamin K group compared to the control group (0.01 ± 0.03 g/cm2 vs -0.008 ± 0.04 g/cm2, P = 0.049).

This receptor profile makes it possible for it to act as a dopamine system stabilizer. Based on various short term and long term studies, aripiprazole has been found to be effective in schizophrenia and has no significant adverse effect on QTc prolongation, prolactin, serum lipids, and has a low potential for weight gain. Present study aims to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of aripiprazole (10-15mg/day) in the treatment of Indian patients of schizophrenia and to see its effect on QTc interval, prolactin levels, serum lipids, plasma sugar and weight gain in these patients. Outpatients with an ongoing/newly diagnosed ICD-10 Schizophrenia (n=136) were randomly assigned to 10 or 15 mg dose of Aripiprazole for a period of six weeks. Clinical response was evaluated by the Positive And Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS), Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale and safety was evaluated by observing spontaneously reported adverse events and changes in various laboratory parameters. Switching schizophrenic patients to aripiprazole (10/15 mg) from both conventional and atypical anti-psychotics was safe and well tolerated. Six weeks after switching to aripiprazole, patients showed improvements in PANSS scores (P< 0.001), EPS, prolactin levels and weight over the baseline levels. No difference was seen in the 10 or 15mg dose groups. One hospitalization was reported (due to hepatitis E). Common side effects reported were insomnia, somnolence, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Aripiprazole is a safe and effective anti psychotic in Indian patients - both in newly diagnosed, as well as, in patients not responding to or intolerant to other available typical and atypical antipsychotics.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"aripiprazole (10-15mg/day)\", \"baseline\", \"Positive And Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS)\", \"significantly increased\", \"Six weeks after switching to aripiprazole, patients showed improvements in PANSS scores (P\\u003c 0.001),\"], [\"aripiprazole (10-15mg/day)\", \"baseline\", \"Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), prolactin levels and weight\", \"no significant difference\", \"EPS, prolactin levels and weight over the baseline levels\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

We also tested whether the presence or severity of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms, and levels of proinflammatory cytokines, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and other blood markers, would predict or impact treatment response.\n\nABSTRACT.METHOD:: Seventy-nine participants (10 dropouts) not currently taking psychotropic medications with at least moderate scores on self-report mood measures were randomly allocated to receive either a probiotic preparation (containing Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum) or a matched placebo, in a double-blind trial for 8 weeks. Data were analysed as intent-to-treat.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: No significant difference was found between the probiotic and placebo groups on any psychological outcome measure (Cohen's d range = 0.07–0.16) or any blood-based biomarker. At end-point, 9 (23%) of those in the probiotic group showed a ⩾60% change on the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (responders), compared to 10 (26%) of those in the placebo group (χ12=0.107, p = ns). Baseline vitamin D level was found to moderate treatment effect on several outcome measures. Dry mouth and sleep disruption were reported more frequently in the placebo group.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:: This study found no evidence that the probiotic formulation is effective in treating low mood, or in moderating the levels of inflammatory and other biomarkers. The lack of observed effect on mood symptoms may be due to the severity, chronicity or treatment resistance of the sample; recruiting an antidepressant-naive sample experiencing mild, acute symptoms of low mood, may well yield a different result. Future studies taking a preventative approach or using probiotics as an adjuvant treatment may also be more effective. Vitamin D levels should be monitored in future studies in the area.

However, no significant changes were found in the MVC (P>0.05 for both groups). There was a significant increase in H-reflex size after HIIT (+24.5%, P=0.004), while it remained unchanged in the control group (P=0.134). No significant changes were observed either in the V-wave or in the Vwave/Mwave ratio (P>0.05 for both groups).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: The Wingate-based training led to an increased peak power together with a higher spinal excitability.

Future studies taking a preventative approach or using probiotics as an adjuvant treatment may also be more effective. Vitamin D levels should be monitored in future studies in the area. The results of this trial are preliminary; future studies in the area should not be discouraged.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"probiotic preparation (containing Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum)\", \"matched placebo\", \"any psychological outcome measure\", \"no significant difference\", \"No significant difference was found between the probiotic and placebo groups on any psychological outcome measure (Cohen's d range = 0.07–0.16) or any blood-based biomarker.\"],\n    [\"probiotic preparation (containing Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum)\", \"matched placebo\", \"Montgomery\\u2013Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MDRS) responders\", \"no significant difference\", \"At end-point, 9 (23%) of those in the probiotic group showed a ⩾60% change on the Montgomery\\u2013Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (responders), compared to 10 (26%) of those in the placebo group (χ12=0.107, p = ns).\"],\n    [\"probiotic preparation (containing Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum)\", \"matched placebo\", \"vitamin D level\", \"moderate effect\", \"Baseline vitamin D level was found to moderate treatment effect on several outcome measures.\"],\n    [null, null, \"dry mouth and sleep disruption\", \"more frequent in placebo group\", \"Dry mouth and sleep disruption were reported more frequently in the placebo group.\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"probiotic preparation (containing Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum)\", \"matched placebo\", \"any psychological outcome measure\", \"no significant difference\", \"No significant difference was found between the probiotic and placebo groups on any psychological outcome measure (Cohen's d range = 0.07–0.16) or any blood-based biomarker.\"],\n    [\"probiotic preparation (containing Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum)\", \"matched placebo\", \"Montgomery\\u2013Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MDRS) responders\", \"no significant difference\", \"At end-point, 9 (23%) of those in the probiotic group showed a ⩾60% change on the Montgomery\\u2013Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (responders), compared to 10 (26%) of those in the placebo group (χ12=0.107, p = ns).\"],\n    [\"probiotic preparation (containing Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum)\", \"matched placebo\", \"vitamin D level\", \"moderate effect\", \"Baseline vitamin D level was found to moderate treatment effect on several outcome measures.\"],\n    [null, null, \"dry mouth and sleep disruption\", \"more frequent in placebo group\", \"Dry mouth and sleep disruption were reported more frequently in the placebo group.\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "1081e8b4051a144ff8e62aad0c09d72dc3be0c4a6076f5a07ac406f2a0f981c3", "prompt_hash": "5f1c275ed3d84599282f96caeb166394465366fb2cef85691ecd4f7e5f5d57ba", "target_hash": "e792afacf17a1da97104fc6c3d49a294165da5b7dc38378022ddbf374823200f", "bypass": null}

However, there is limited research on chronic alcohol consumption with Helicobacter pylori infection. We sought to investigate the relationship between the cytokine profile, oxidative balance and H. pylori infection in subjects with chronic alcohol consumption. A total of 142 subjects were divided into three groups: 59 subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion and H. pylori infection (group A); 53 subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion without H. pylori infection (group B); and 30 control subjects (group C). The serum levels of CagA, interleukin (IL)-10, E-selectin, TNF-α, malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found that the ages and serum H. pylori CagA levels among the three groups, as well as both the mean drinking age and the mean daily alcohol consumption between groups A and B, were matched and comparable. Comparing the BMIs among the three groups, the BMI differences were found to be statistically significant (F=3.921, P<0.05). Compared with group C, the BMIs in groups A and B were significantly higher (P<0.001 and P<0.01, respectively); however, the BMI differences between group A and group B were not statistically significant (P>0.05). Additionally, no differences in the serum CagA levels were found in comparisons among the groups (all P>0.05). The serum IL-10 and E-selectin levels in group A were significantly lower than those in group B (serum IL-10: P<0.05; E-selectin: P<0.05). The serum IL-10 in group A was significantly higher than that in group C (P<0.01); the serum E-selectin levels in group A did not significantly differ compared with those in group C (P>0.05). Furthermore, the serum IL-10 and E-selectin levels in group B were significantly higher than those in group C (serum IL-10: P<0.001; E-selectin: P<0.05); however, the serum TNF-α levels did not differ among groups (all P>0.05). Although the serum levels of MDA and SOD in groups A and B were slightly lower than those in group C, there were no significant differences among groups (all P>0.05). In conclusion, we believe that H. pylori infection might cause a significant inhibition of certain cytokine profiles in subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion. Moreover, chronically ingested alcohol may exert an adjusted inflammatory effect, but there was no association between H. pylori infection, chronic alcohol consumption and oxidative balance.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"Alcohol consumption \", \"Control\", \"TNF-\\u03b1 \", \"no significant difference\", \"the serum TNF-\\u03b1 levels did not differ among groups (all P\\u003e0.05).\"], [\"Alcohol consumption + H. pylori \", \"Alcohol consumption\", \"E-selectin\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The serum IL-10 and E-selectin levels in group A were significantly lower than those in group B (serum IL-10: P\\u003c0.05; E-selectin: P\\u003c0.05).\"], [\"Alcohol consumption + H. pylori \", \"Control\", \"E-selectin\", \"no significant difference\", \"The serum IL-10 in group A was significantly higher than that in group C (P\\u003c0.01); the serum E-selectin levels in group A did not significantly differ compared with those in group C (P\\u003e0.05).\"], [\"Alcohol consumption \", \"Control\", \"E-selectin\", \"significantly increased\", \"Furthermore, the serum IL-10 and E-selectin levels in group B were significantly higher than those in group C (serum IL-10: P\\u003c0.001; E-selectin: P\\u003c0.05);\"], [\"Alcohol consumption + H. pylori \", \"Alcohol consumption\", \"IL-10\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The serum IL-10 and E-selectin levels in group A were significantly lower than those in group B (serum IL-10: P\\u003c0.05; E-selectin: P\\u003c0.05).\"], [\"Alcohol consumption + H. pylori \", \"Control\", \"IL-10\", \"significantly increased\", \"The serum IL-10 in group A was significantly higher than that in group C (P\\u003c0.01);\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:143"}, "target": "[[\"Alcohol consumption \", \"Control\", \"TNF-\\u03b1 \", \"no significant difference\", \"the serum TNF-\\u03b1 levels did not differ among groups (all P\\u003e0.05).\"], [\"Alcohol consumption + H. pylori \", \"Alcohol consumption\", \"E-selectin\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The serum IL-10 and E-selectin levels in group A were significantly lower than those in group B (serum IL-10: P\\u003c0.05; E-selectin: P\\u003c0.05).\"], [\"Alcohol consumption + H. pylori \", \"Control\", \"E-selectin\", \"no significant difference\", \"The serum IL-10 in group A was significantly higher than that in group C (P\\u003c0.01); the serum E-selectin levels in group A did not significantly differ compared with those in group C (P\\u003e0.05).\"], [\"Alcohol consumption \", \"Control\", \"E-selectin\", \"significantly increased\", \"Furthermore, the serum IL-10 and E-selectin levels in group B were significantly higher than those in group C (serum IL-10: P\\u003c0.001; E-selectin: P\\u003c0.05);\"], [\"Alcohol consumption + H. pylori \", \"Alcohol consumption\", \"IL-10\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The serum IL-10 and E-selectin levels in group A were significantly lower than those in group B (serum IL-10: P\\u003c0.05; E-selectin: P\\u003c0.05).\"], [\"Alcohol consumption + H. pylori \", \"Control\", \"IL-10\", \"significantly increased\", \"The serum IL-10 in group A was significantly higher than that in group C (P\\u003c0.01);\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

This study aims to assess changes in attitudes toward patient safety culture and frequency of quality-related event (QRE) reporting after guided implementation of a continuous quality improvement (CQI) program in a panel of community pharmacies in the United States (U.S.).\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Twenty-one community pharmacies volunteered to participate in the project and were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. Pharmacy staff in the intervention group received guided training to ensure full implementation of a CQI program while those in the control group partially implemented the program. Pharmacy staff in both groups completed retrospective pre-post safety culture questionnaires and reported medication errors and near misses that occurred in their practices. Rasch analysis was applied to assess questionnaire validity and reliability and to confirm if the ordinal level data approximated interval level measures. Paired t-tests and repeated measure analysis of covariance tests were subsequently used to compare observed changes in the attitudes of subjects and frequency of QREs reporting in intervention and control groups.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Sixty-nine employees completed the questionnaire, a 43.9% response rate. Improvement in attitudes toward patient safety was statistically significant in the intervention group in six domains: staff, training, and skill (p = 0.017); patient counseling (p = 0.043); communication about mistakes (p < 0.001); response to mistakes (p < 0.001); organizational learning – continuous improvement (p < 0.001); and overall patient safety perceptions (p = 0.033). No significant differences were observed in QRE reporting rates between intervention and control groups. However, differences were observed in the types of QREs reported (e.g., incorrect safety cap) and the point in the prescription processing workflow where a QRE was detected (e.g., partner check station, and drug utilization review station) in the intervention group (p < 0.001).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Guided CQI program implementation increased the self-reported patient safety culture attitudes among staff.\n\nABSTRACT.ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (10.1186/s40545-017-0114-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Continuous quality improvement program\", \"Control\", \"Communication about mistakes\", \"significantly increased\", \"Improvement in attitudes toward patient safety was statistically significant in the intervention group in six domains: staff, training, and skill (p = 0.017); patient counseling (p = 0.043); communication about mistakes (p \\u003c 0.001); response to mistakes (p \\u003c 0.001); organizational learning \\u2013 continuous improvement (p \\u003c 0.001); and overall patient safety perceptions (p = 0.033).\"], [\"Continuous quality improvement program\", \"Control\", \"Patient counseling\", \"significantly increased\", \".

Additionally, the in-patient medical costs of both treatment arms were compared. 40 patients with solid tumours were randomized to receive HD-VIC chemotherapy with or without amifostine (910 mg/m2 at day 1–3) given as a short infusion prior to carboplatin and ifosfamide. Patients were stratified according to pretreatment. HDCT consisted of an 18 h infusion of carboplatin (500 mg/m2/d over 18 h), ifosfamide (4 g/m2/d over 4 h) and etoposide (500 mg/m2/d) all given for 3 consecutive days. All patients received prophylactic application of G-CSF (5 μg kg−1 subcutaneously) to ameliorate neutropenia after treatment. Patients were monitored for nephrotoxicity, gastrointestinal side effects, haematopoietic recovery, as well as frequency of fever and infections. The median fall of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 10% from baseline in the amifostine group (105 to 95 ml min−1) and 37% in the control patient group (107 to 67 ml min−1) (P< 0.01). Amifostine-treated patients revealed a less pronounced increase in albumine and low molecular weight protein urinary excretion. Stomatitis grade III/IV occurred in 25% without versus 0% of patients with amifostine (P = 0.01). Acute nausea/vomiting was frequently observed immediately during or after the application of amifostine despite intensive antiemetic prophylaxis consisting of 5-HT3-receptor antagonists/dexamethasone/trifluorpromazine. However, delayed emesis occurred more often in the control patients. Engraftment of neutrophil (> 500 μl−1) and thrombocytes (> 25 000 μl−1)were observed at days 9 versus 10 and 10 versus 12, respectively, both slightly in favour of the amifostine arm. In addition, a lower number of days with fever and a shortened duration of hospital stay were observed in the amifostine arm. The reduction of acute toxicity observed in the amifostine arm resulted in 30% savings in costs for supportive care (Euro 4396 versus Euro 3153 per patient). Taking into account the drug costs of amifostine, calculation of in-patient treatment costs from the start of chemotherapy to discharge revealed additional costs of Euro 540 per patient in the amifostine arm. This randomized pilot study indicates that both organ and haematotoxicity of HD-VIC chemotherapy can be ameliorated by the use of amifostine. Additionally, a nearly complete preservation of GFR was observed in amifostine-treated patients which may be advantageous if repetitive cycles of HDCT are planned.

We measured bone mass density (BMD) and bone turnover biomarkers (osteocalcin, osteocalcin, procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP), alkaline phosphatase, type I collagen cross-linked C-telopeptide (CTx), and osteoprotegerin). We assessed renal function by estimated creatinine clearance, plasma cystatin C, and urinary levels of creatinine, albumin, cystatin C, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL). The changes from baseline in BMD and renal and bone biomarkers were compared across study arms.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Of 40 included patients, 35 completed 48 weeks of randomized therapy and follow up. BMD was measured in 33, 26, and 27 patients at baseline, week 24, and week 48, respectively. In TDF/FTC-treated patients we observed significant reductions from baseline in hip and lumbar spine BMD at week 24 (−1.8% and −2.5%) and week 48 (−2.1% and −2.1%), whereas BMD was stable in patients in the ABC/3TC arm. The changes from baseline in BMD were significantly different between study arms. All bone turnover biomarkers except osteoprotegerin increased in the TDF/FTC arm compared with the ABC/3TC arm, but early changes did not predict subsequent loss of BMD. Renal function parameters were similar between study arms although a small increase in NGAL was detected among TDF-treated patients.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Switching to TDF/FTC-based therapy led to decreases in BMD and increases in bone turnover markers compared with ABC/3TC-based treatment.

Additionally, the in-patient medical costs of both treatment arms were compared. 40 patients with solid tumours were randomized to receive HD-VIC chemotherapy with or without amifostine (910 mg/m2 at day 1–3) given as a short infusion prior to carboplatin and ifosfamide. Patients were stratified according to pretreatment. HDCT consisted of an 18 h infusion of carboplatin (500 mg/m2/d over 18 h), ifosfamide (4 g/m2/d over 4 h) and etoposide (500 mg/m2/d) all given for 3 consecutive days. All patients received prophylactic application of G-CSF (5 μg kg−1 subcutaneously) to ameliorate neutropenia after treatment. Patients were monitored for nephrotoxicity, gastrointestinal side effects, haematopoietic recovery, as well as frequency of fever and infections. The median fall of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 10% from baseline in the amifostine group (105 to 95 ml min−1) and 37% in the control patient group (107 to 67 ml min−1) (P< 0.01). Amifostine-treated patients revealed a less pronounced increase in albumine and low molecular weight protein urinary excretion. Stomatitis grade III/IV occurred in 25% without versus 0% of patients with amifostine (P = 0.01). Acute nausea/vomiting was frequently observed immediately during or after the application of amifostine despite intensive antiemetic prophylaxis consisting of 5-HT3-receptor antagonists/dexamethasone/trifluorpromazine. However, delayed emesis occurred more often in the control patients. Engraftment of neutrophil (> 500 μl−1) and thrombocytes (> 25 000 μl−1)were observed at days 9 versus 10 and 10 versus 12, respectively, both slightly in favour of the amifostine arm. In addition, a lower number of days with fever and a shortened duration of hospital stay were observed in the amifostine arm. The reduction of acute toxicity observed in the amifostine arm resulted in 30% savings in costs for supportive care (Euro 4396 versus Euro 3153 per patient). Taking into account the drug costs of amifostine, calculation of in-patient treatment costs from the start of chemotherapy to discharge revealed additional costs of Euro 540 per patient in the amifostine arm. This randomized pilot study indicates that both organ and haematotoxicity of HD-VIC chemotherapy can be ameliorated by the use of amifostine. Additionally, a nearly complete preservation of GFR was observed in amifostine-treated patients which may be advantageous if repetitive cycles of HDCT are planned.

A recent study speculated that anesthesia induction using propofol 2 mg/kg transiently reduced left ventricular (LV) contraction by analyzing tissue Doppler-derived imaging (TDI) during induction phase. The purpose of this study was to analyze and to compare the impacts of propofol- and thiopental-induction on LV function.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Twenty-four female patients with normal LV function undergoing non-cardiac surgery were randomly administered intravenous bolus thiopental (5 mg/kg, Thiopental-group, n = 12) or propofol (2 mg/kg, Propofol-group, n = 12) for anesthesia-induction. TDI of septal mitral annular velocity during systole (S'), early diastole (e') and atrial contraction (a') were determined by transthoracic echocardiography before and 1, 3, and 5 minutes after thiopental/propofol administration (T0, T1, T2, and T3, respectively).\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The bispectral index and systolic blood pressure declined significantly during anesthesia induction in both groups, however, more depressed in Thiopental-group compared with those in Propofol-group at T2 and T3 (all, p < 0.05).

End points were response rate, HRQOL and survival. HRQOL was assessed using the EORCT QLQ-C30 at baseline and after the third cycle of chemotherapy.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The baseline HRQOL scores were comparable between two groups. After treatment improvement was seen in a number of items and domains except for cognitive functioning, and diarrhoea. Pain decreased and physical functioning improved in both groups. However, only the TCF group showed statistically and clinically meaningful improvement in global QOL (P = 0.001). Surgical and pathologic response was better with TCF but there was no difference in survival rate between two groups.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Docetaxel based treatment (TCF) showed better palliation and improvement of global QOL as compared with epirubicin based treatment (ECF).

To assess the impact of brief smoking on the vasculature, we determined levels of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and circulating microparticles (MPs) following the smoking of one cigarette by young, healthy intermittent smokers.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS: 12 healthy volunteers were randomized to either smoking or not smoking in a crossover fashion.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of rosuvastatin, alone or associated with zinc and selenium supplementation, on lipid profile, antioxidant enzymes and mineral status in coronary artery disease patients.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A double-blind randomized clinical trial was performed in which patients (n = 76) were treated with 10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months associated or not with zinc (30 mg/d) and selenium (150 μg/d) supplementation. The following parameters were analyzed before and after the intervention: anthropometric measurements, lipid profile, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), electronegative low density lipoprotein (LDL(-)) concentrations, activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), zinc and selenium concentrations in blood plasma and erythocytes. Significance was determined using an α of 5% (two-tailed).\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: We found that rosuvastatin therapy was efficient in reducing total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and hs-CRP independently of mineral supplementation. Neither treatment was associated with significant changes in LDL(-). Similarly, the antioxidant enzymes GPx and SOD activity were unchanged by treatments. Neither treatment was associated with significant differences in concentrations of zinc or selenium in blood plasma and erythocytes of studied groups.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Rosuvastatin treatment did not affect zinc and selenium levels in coronary artery disease patients. The zinc and selenium supplementation at doses used in this study did not change lipid profile or SOD and GPx activity in patients receiving rosuvastatin. Further studies should be focused on testing alternative doses and supplements in different populations to contribute for a consensus on the ideal choice of antioxidants to be used as possible complementary therapies in atherosclerotic patients.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01547377\n\n\nFindings:\n[[\"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months with zinc (30 mg/d) and selenium (150 I\\u03021\\u20444g/d) supplementation.\", \"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months\", \"glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels\", \"no significant difference\", \"Similarly, the activities of the antioxidant enzymes GPx and SOD were unchanged by treatments (P \\u003e 0.42) and were similar in both groups (P \\u003e 0.33).\"], [\"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months with zinc (30 mg/d) and selenium (150 I\\u03021\\u20444g/d) supplementation.\", \"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months\", \"glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels\", \"no significant difference\", \"Similarly, the antioxidant enzymes GPx and SOD activity were unchanged by treatments.\"], [\"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months with zinc (30 mg/d) and selenium (150 I\\u03021\\u20444g/d) supplementation.\", \"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months\", \"total cholesterol, LDL-c, and non-HDL-c levels\", \"no significant difference\", \"Significant decreases in total cholesterol, LDL-c, and non-HDL-c levels were observed for all patients, regardless of group; however, there were no differences between the rosuvastatin + mineral-supplemented and rosuvastatin + placebo groups (P \\u003e 0.21).\"], [\"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months with zinc (30 mg/d) and selenium (150 I\\u03021\\u20444g/d) supplementation.\", \"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months\", \"Triglycerides concentrations\", \"no significant difference\", \"Triglycerides concentrations dropped noticeably in both groups, though this pattern was significant only for the placebo group (P = 0.034); despite this, differences between the two groups were not significant (P = 0.76).\"], [\"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months with zinc (30 mg/d) supplementation.\", \"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months with selenium (150 I\\u03021\\u20444g/d) supplementation.\", \"concentrations of zinc and selenium of studied groups.\", \"no significant difference\", \"Neither treatment was associated with significant differences in concentrations of zinc (plasma: P \\u003e 0.14; erythrocyte: P \\u003e 0.14) or selenium (plasma: P \\u003e 0.63; erythrocyte: P \\u003e 0.07) of studied groups.\"], [\"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months with zinc (30 mg/d) supplementation.\", \"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months with selenium (150 I\\u03021\\u20444g/d) supplementation.\", \"concentrations of zinc and selenium of studied groups.\", \"no significant difference\", \"Neither treatment was associated with significant differences in concentrations of zinc or selenium in blood plasma and erythocytes of studied groups.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

We investigated the possible effects of Bifidobacterium animalisssp. lactis 420 (B420) and the dietary fiber Litesse® Ultra polydextrose (LU) on body fat mass and other obesity-related parameters.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: 225 healthy volunteers (healthy, BMI 28–34.9) were randomized into four groups (1:1:1:1), using a computer-generated sequence, for 6 months of double-blind, parallel treatment: 1) Placebo, microcrystalline cellulose, 12 g/d; 2) LU, 12 g/d; 3) B420, 1010 CFU/d in microcrystalline cellulose, 12 g/d; 4) LU + B420, 12 g + 1010 CFU/d. Body composition was monitored with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and the primary outcome was relative change in body fat mass, comparing treatment groups to Placebo. Other outcomes included anthropometric measurements, food intake and blood and fecal biomarkers. The study was registered in Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01978691).\n\nABSTRACT.FINDINGS: There were marked differences in the results of the Intention-To-Treat (ITT; n = 209) and Per Protocol (PP; n = 134) study populations. The PP analysis included only those participants who completed the intervention with > 80% product compliance and no antibiotic use. In addition, three participants were excluded from DXA analyses for PP due to a long delay between the end of intervention and the last DXA measurement. There were no significant differences between groups in body fat mass in the ITT population. However, LU + B420 and B420 seemed to improve weight management in the PP population. For relative change in body fat mass, LU + B420 showed a − 4.5% (− 1.4 kg, P = 0.02, N = 37) difference to the Placebo group, whereas LU (+ 0.3%, P = 1.00, N = 35) and B420 (− 3.0%, P = 0.28, N = 24) alone had no effect (overall ANOVA P = 0.095, Placebo N = 35). A post-hoc factorial analysis was significant for B420 (− 4.0%, P = 0.002 vs. Placebo). Changes in fat mass were most pronounced in the abdominal region, and were reflected by similar changes in waist circumference. B420 and LU + B420 also significantly reduced energy intake compared to Placebo. Changes in blood zonulin levels and hsCRP were associated with corresponding changes in trunk fat mass in the LU + B420 group and in the overall population. There were no differences between groups in the incidence of adverse events.\n\nABSTRACT.DISCUSSION: This clinical trial demonstrates that a probiotic product with or without dietary fiber controls body fat mass. B420 and LU + B420 also reduced waist circumference and food intake, whereas LU alone had no effect on the measured outcomes.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"Litesse\\u00ae Ultra polydextrose  \\u0301+ Bifidobacterium animalisssp. lactis 420\", \"Placebo\", \"Energy intake\", \"significantly decreased\", \"B420 and LU + B420 also significantly reduced energy intake compared to Placebo.\"], [\"Bifidobacterium animalisssp.lactis 420\", \"Placebo\", \"Adverse events\", \"no significant difference\", \"There were no differences between groups in the incidence of adverse events.\"], [\"Litesse\\u00ae Ultra polydextrose  \\u0301+ Bifidobacterium animalisssp. lactis 420\", \"Placebo\", \"Body fat mass\", \"significantly decreased\", \"here were no significant differences between groups in body fat mass in the ITT population.

We studied two different doses of neostigmine.\n\nABSTRACT.PATIENTS & METHODS:: A randomized double blind study was conducted on ninety adult females scheduled for lower intra abdominal surgeries. The study was designed to compare two doses of epidural neostigmine co administered with lignocaine, with regard to its analgesic efficacy and its effect on sedation in postoperative period. Patients were divided into three groups of 30 each. Group I received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with normal saline (1ml), group II lignocaine1% (9ml) with neostigmine 100μg in saline (1ml) and group III received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with neostigmine 200μg in NS (1ml). Group I served as a control. In operating room, after putting epidural catheter, general anesthesia was administered with propofol (2mg kg-1), succinylcholine (2mg kg-1) and maintained with O2, N2O, relaxant technique. At the end of surgery, patients were reversed. Epidural analgesic medication was administered to after proper recovery from anesthesia. Intensity of pain relief on VAS, duration of analgesia, level of sensory block, motor blockade, sedation by sedation score and complications were assessed.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: The addition of neostigmine resulted in significant longer duration of analgesia (dose independent) and sedation (dose dependent). Sensory and motor blockade were identical in all three groups. There was no incidence of respiratory depression, pruritus, bradycardia or hypotension in any group. Two patients in control group and one, receiving neostigmine (200μg), developed nausea/vomiting.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: Co administration of epidural neostigmine and lignocaine appears to be a useful technique for postoperative analgesia as it increases the duration of analgesia and provides desirable sedation at the same time.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Group I received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with normal saline (1ml)\", \"group II lignocaine1% (9ml) with neostigmine 100\\u03bcg in saline (1ml) and group III received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with neostigmine 200\\u03bcg in NS (1ml)\", \"sensory blockade\", \"no significant difference\", \"Sensory and motor blockade were identical in all three groups.\"], [\"Group I received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with normal saline (1ml)\", \"group II lignocaine1% (9ml) with neostigmine 100\\u03bcg in saline (1ml) and group III received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with neostigmine 200\\u03bcg in NS (1ml)\", \"duration of analgesia\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The addition of neostigmine resulted in significant longer duration of analgesia (dose independent) and sedation (dose dependent).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

We investigated the possible effects of Bifidobacterium animalisssp. lactis 420 (B420) and the dietary fiber Litesse® Ultra polydextrose (LU) on body fat mass and other obesity-related parameters.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: 225 healthy volunteers (healthy, BMI 28–34.9) were randomized into four groups (1:1:1:1), using a computer-generated sequence, for 6 months of double-blind, parallel treatment: 1) Placebo, microcrystalline cellulose, 12 g/d; 2) LU, 12 g/d; 3) B420, 1010 CFU/d in microcrystalline cellulose, 12 g/d; 4) LU + B420, 12 g + 1010 CFU/d. Body composition was monitored with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and the primary outcome was relative change in body fat mass, comparing treatment groups to Placebo. Other outcomes included anthropometric measurements, food intake and blood and fecal biomarkers. The study was registered in Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01978691).\n\nABSTRACT.FINDINGS: There were marked differences in the results of the Intention-To-Treat (ITT; n = 209) and Per Protocol (PP; n = 134) study populations. The PP analysis included only those participants who completed the intervention with > 80% product compliance and no antibiotic use. In addition, three participants were excluded from DXA analyses for PP due to a long delay between the end of intervention and the last DXA measurement. There were no significant differences between groups in body fat mass in the ITT population. However, LU + B420 and B420 seemed to improve weight management in the PP population. For relative change in body fat mass, LU + B420 showed a − 4.5% (− 1.4 kg, P = 0.02, N = 37) difference to the Placebo group, whereas LU (+ 0.3%, P = 1.00, N = 35) and B420 (− 3.0%, P = 0.28, N = 24) alone had no effect (overall ANOVA P = 0.095, Placebo N = 35). A post-hoc factorial analysis was significant for B420 (− 4.0%, P = 0.002 vs. Placebo). Changes in fat mass were most pronounced in the abdominal region, and were reflected by similar changes in waist circumference. B420 and LU + B420 also significantly reduced energy intake compared to Placebo. Changes in blood zonulin levels and hsCRP were associated with corresponding changes in trunk fat mass in the LU + B420 group and in the overall population. There were no differences between groups in the incidence of adverse events.\n\nABSTRACT.DISCUSSION: This clinical trial demonstrates that a probiotic product with or without dietary fiber controls body fat mass. B420 and LU + B420 also reduced waist circumference and food intake, whereas LU alone had no effect on the measured outcomes.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"B420, 1010 CFU/d in microcrystalline cellulose, 12 g/d\", \"Placebo\", \"relative change in body fat mass\", \"significantly decreased\", \"LU + B420 showed a − 4.5% (− 1.4 kg, P = 0.02, N = 37) difference to the Placebo group, whereas LU (+ 0.3%, P = 1.00, N = 35) and B420 (− 3.0%, P = 0.28, N = 24) alone had no effect (overall ANOVA P = 0.095, Placebo N = 35).

However, it is still unknown which type of exercise affects cognition. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that a demanding balance training program improves memory and spatial cognition. Forty healthy participants aged 19–65 years were randomly assigned to either a balance or relaxation training intervention. Each group exercised twice a week for a total of 12 weeks. Pre- and posttests assessed balance performance, cardiorespiratory fitness, memory, spatial cognition, and executive functions. Only the balance group significantly increased in balance performance from pre- to posttest, while cardiorespiratory fitness remained unchanged in both groups. Moreover, the balance group significantly improved in memory and spatial cognition. Effects on executive functions were not observed. These results suggest that balance training is capable of improving particularly memory and spatial cognition. Therefore, an increase in cardiorespiratory fitness does not seem to be necessary to induce beneficial effects of physical exercise on cognition. It might be speculated that stimulating the vestibular system during balance training induces changes of the hippocampus and parietal cortex possibly via direct pathways between the vestibular system and these brain regions.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"demanding balance training program\", \"relaxation group\", \"memory score\", \"significantly increased\", \"oreover, the balance group significantly improved in memory and spatial cognition. \"], [\"demanding balance training program\", \"relaxation group\", \"memory score\", \"significantly increased\", \"hese results suggest that balance training is capable of improving particularly memory and spatial cognition. \"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Delivering brief alcohol interventions to employees as part of a health check may be acceptable, particularly with online delivery which can provide privacy for this stigmatised behaviour. Research to support this approach is limited and methodologically weak. The aim was to determine the effectiveness of online screening and personalised feedback on alcohol consumption, delivered in a workplace as part of a health check.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS AND FINDINGS: This two-group online individually randomised controlled trial recruited employees from a UK-based private sector organisation (approx. 100,000 employees). 3,375 employees completed the online health check in the three week recruitment period. Of these, 1,330 (39%) scored five or more on the AUDIT-C (indicating alcohol misuse) and were randomised to receive personalised feedback on their alcohol intake, alongside feedback on other health behaviours (n = 659), or to receive feedback on all health behaviours except alcohol intake (n = 671). Participants were mostly male (75%), with a median age of 48 years and half were in managerial positions (55%). Median Body Mass Index was 26, 12% were smokers, median time undertaking moderate/vigorous physical activity a week was 173 minutes and median fruit and vegetable consumption was three portions a day.

The purpose of this study was evaluation of effect of Semelil (ANGIPARSTM), a new herbal drug for treatment of diabetic foot ulcers or diabetic peripheral neuropathy.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: In this double blind clinical trial, 49 type 2 diabetes patients with different degrees of neuropathy were evaluated in two groups (ANGIPARSTM and placebo groups). All patients were assessed at the start and 12 weeks after treatment, with laboratory tests, United Kingdom screening test, Michigan neuropathy screening score, Michigan diabetic neuropathy score, vibration perception thresholds, nerve conduction study, monofilament test and visual analog scale.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Michigan diabetic neuropathy score was decreased notably in ANGIPARSTM group. In the nerve conduction study, appropriate meaningful changes were observed in the distal latency and amplitude in the motor Ulnar nerve in ANGIPARSTM group.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: The results showed limited evidence of efficacy of ANGIPARSTM in diabetic neuropathy treatment and more studies with a larger sample size and longer duration are required.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Semelil (ANGIPARSTM)\", \"Placebo\", \"Michigan diabetic neuropathy score\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Michigan diabetic neuropathy score was decreased notably in ANGIPARSTM group.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Delivering brief alcohol interventions to employees as part of a health check may be acceptable, particularly with online delivery which can provide privacy for this stigmatised behaviour. Research to support this approach is limited and methodologically weak. The aim was to determine the effectiveness of online screening and personalised feedback on alcohol consumption, delivered in a workplace as part of a health check.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS AND FINDINGS: This two-group online individually randomised controlled trial recruited employees from a UK-based private sector organisation (approx. 100,000 employees). 3,375 employees completed the online health check in the three week recruitment period. Of these, 1,330 (39%) scored five or more on the AUDIT-C (indicating alcohol misuse) and were randomised to receive personalised feedback on their alcohol intake, alongside feedback on other health behaviours (n = 659), or to receive feedback on all health behaviours except alcohol intake (n = 671). Participants were mostly male (75%), with a median age of 48 years and half were in managerial positions (55%). Median Body Mass Index was 26, 12% were smokers, median time undertaking moderate/vigorous physical activity a week was 173 minutes and median fruit and vegetable consumption was three portions a day. Eighty percent (n = 1,066) of participants completed follow-up questionnaires at three months. An intention to treat analysis found no difference between experimental groups for past week drinking (primary outcome) (5.6% increase associated with the intervention (95% CI −4.7% to 16.9%; p = .30)), AUDIT (measure of alcohol-related harm) and health utility (EQ-5D).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence to support the use of personalised feedback within an online health check for reducing alcohol consumption among employees in this organisation.

In a randomized crossover design, 12 healthy individuals (6M/6F; BMI 22.2 ± 0.4 kg/m2; 27 ± 1.3 years, mean ± SEM) underwent 50 g OGTT (A) and 3 breakfasts (B1: milk and cereals; B2: milk, apple, and chocolate cream-filled sponge cake; B3: milk, apple, bread, and hazelnut chocolate cream) to assess plasma glucose-, insulin-, and ghrelin excursions. An electroencephalography was performed before and 100 min after consumption of each load to measure the latency of frontal P300 evoked potentials as index of cognitive performance. Breakfasts B1 and B2 exhibited significantly lower glycemic and insulinemic responses as compared to A. Breakfast B3 exhibited significantly lower glycemic, but not insulinemic response, as compared to A. Final plasma ghrelin inhibition was more pronounced, albeit not significantly, in all breakfasts with respect to A. P300 latency tended to decrease following each of the three breakfasts, but B3 was the only breakfast capable to elicit a statistically significant reduction in P300 latency with respect to A (p < 0.01), suggesting ameliorated cognitive performance.

This study aims to assess changes in attitudes toward patient safety culture and frequency of quality-related event (QRE) reporting after guided implementation of a continuous quality improvement (CQI) program in a panel of community pharmacies in the United States (U.S.).\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Twenty-one community pharmacies volunteered to participate in the project and were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. Pharmacy staff in the intervention group received guided training to ensure full implementation of a CQI program while those in the control group partially implemented the program. Pharmacy staff in both groups completed retrospective pre-post safety culture questionnaires and reported medication errors and near misses that occurred in their practices. Rasch analysis was applied to assess questionnaire validity and reliability and to confirm if the ordinal level data approximated interval level measures. Paired t-tests and repeated measure analysis of covariance tests were subsequently used to compare observed changes in the attitudes of subjects and frequency of QREs reporting in intervention and control groups.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Sixty-nine employees completed the questionnaire, a 43.9% response rate. Improvement in attitudes toward patient safety was statistically significant in the intervention group in six domains: staff, training, and skill (p = 0.017); patient counseling (p = 0.043); communication about mistakes (p < 0.001); response to mistakes (p < 0.001); organizational learning – continuous improvement (p < 0.001); and overall patient safety perceptions (p = 0.033). No significant differences were observed in QRE reporting rates between intervention and control groups. However, differences were observed in the types of QREs reported (e.g., incorrect safety cap) and the point in the prescription processing workflow where a QRE was detected (e.g., partner check station, and drug utilization review station) in the intervention group (p < 0.001).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Guided CQI program implementation increased the self-reported patient safety culture attitudes among staff.\n\nABSTRACT.ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (10.1186/s40545-017-0114-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Continuous quality improvement program\", \"Control\", \"Communication about mistakes\", \"significantly increased\", \"Improvement in attitudes toward patient safety was statistically significant in the intervention group in six domains: staff, training, and skill (p = 0.017); patient counseling (p = 0.043); communication about mistakes (p \\u003c 0.001); response to mistakes (p \\u003c 0.001); organizational learning \\u2013 continuous improvement (p \\u003c 0.001); and overall patient safety perceptions (p = 0.033).\"], [\"Continuous quality improvement program\", \"Control\", \"Patient counseling\", \"significantly increased\", \".

However, a correlation between the neuropeptide oxytocin in cerebrospinal fluid and the severity of OCD has previously been shown, and oxytocin and serotonin are interconnected within the brain. Few studies have investigated whether SRIs have any effect on oxytocin; thus, our aim was to explore the possibility that oxytocinergic mechanisms contribute to the anti-obsessive effect of SRIs.\n\nABSTRACT.METHOD: In a randomized, double-blind trial, comparing SRIs (clomipramine and paroxetine) with placebo in 36 adults with OCD (characterized for subtypes), plasma oxytocin was measured with radioimmunoassay after plasma extraction, at baseline, after 1 week, and after 4 weeks of treatment, and related to baseline severity and clinical response after 12 weeks, as measured by the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS).\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Baseline oxytocin levels correlated positively with baseline Y-BOCS ratings, but only among the future SRI responders. Patients with early onset of OCD had higher baseline oxytocin. During treatment, plasma oxytocin did not differ between SRI and placebo treatment. In SRI responders, plasma oxytocin first decreased and then increased; in non-responders (to SRI as well as to placebo), the reverse was the case. After 4 weeks, treatment responders had attained higher oxytocin levels compared to non-responders. The intra-individual range (i.e. the variability) of plasma oxytocin between measurements was the measure that best differentiated responders from non-responders. This range was higher in responders than non-responders, and lower in patients with autistic traits.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: SRIs have highly variable effects on plasma oxytocin between individuals.

A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, two-period crossover study in adult patients receiving around-the-clock full opioid agonist therapy and confirmed to be opioid dependent by naloxone challenge. Study doses were substituted at the time of the regular dose schedule for each patient. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a maximum Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale score ≥ 13 (moderate withdrawal) or use of rescue medication. <p> Results. 35 subjects on ≥ 80 mg morphine sulfate equivalent per day were evaluable for opioid withdrawal. One patient during buccal buprenorphine treatment and two during 50% full μ-opioid agonist treatment experienced opioid withdrawal of at least moderate intensity. The mean maximum Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale scores were similar, and numerically lower on buccal buprenorphine. There were no significant differences in pain ratings between treatments. The most frequent adverse events with buccal buprenorphine were headache (19%), vomiting (13%), nausea, diarrhea, and drug withdrawal syndrome (each 9%), and with full μ-opioid agonist were headache (16%), drug withdrawal syndrome (13%), and nausea (6%). <p> Conclusions. Chronic pain patients treated with around-the-clock full μ-opioid agonist therapy can be switched to buccal buprenorphine (a partial μ-opioid agonist) at approximately 50% of the full μ-opioid agonist dose without an increased risk of opioid withdrawal or loss of pain control.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Buccal buprenorphine (BBUP)\", \"Full \\u03bc-opioid agonist*\", \"pain ratings\", \"no significant difference\", \"There were no significant differences in pain ratings between treatments.\"], [\"Buccal buprenorphine (BBUP)\", \"Full \\u03bc-opioid agonist*\", \"Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale(COWS) - 24-hour period\", \"no significant difference\", \"The mean maximum Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale scores were similar, and numerically lower on buccal buprenorphine\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) secreted by the embryo is known to play a key role in this process and to trigger a complex signal transduction cascade allowing the apposition, attachment, and invasion of the embryo into the decidualized uterus. Production of hCG was reported to be dependent on blastocyst quality and several articles suggested that intrauterine hCG injection increases pregnancy and implantation rates in IVF patients. However, no study has as yet analysed birth rates as final outcome. Our objective was to determine whether clinical outcome after blastocyst transfer can be improved by intrauterine injection of hCG and whether this is dependent on blastocyst quality.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: A prospective randomised study was conducted in two settings. In cohort A, hCG application was performed two days before blastocyst transfer. In cohort B, the administration of hCG occurred just prior to embryo transfer on day 5. For both cohorts, patients were randomised to either intrauterine hCG application or to the control group that received culture medium. Clinical outcome was analysed according to blastocyst quality of transferred embryos.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The outcome of 182 IVF-cycles (cohort A) and 1004 IVF-cycles (cohort B) was analysed. All patients received a fresh autologous blastocyst transfer on day five. Primary outcomes were pregnancy rates (PR), clinical pregnancy rates (cPR), miscarriage rates (MR), and live birth rates (LBR). No improvement of clinical outcome after intrauterine hCG administration on day 3 (cohort A) or day 5 (cohort B) was found, independently of blastocyst quality transferred. The final outcome in cohort A: LBR after transfer of top blastocysts was 50.0 % with hCG and 53.3 % in the control group. With non-top blastocysts, LBR of 17.1 % (hCG) and 18.2 % (control) were observed (n.s.). In cohort B, LBR with top blastocysts was 53.3 % (hCG) and 48.4 % (control), with non-top blastocysts it came to 28.7 % (hCG) and 35.0 % (control). The differences between the groups were statistically not significant. Furthermore, we investigated a possible benefit of hCG administration in correlation with female age. In both age groups (<38 years and ≥ 38 years) we found similar LBR after treatment with hCG vs. medium.

The purpose of present study was to determine the effect of acute and 14-day Coenzyme Q10\nsupplementation on inflammatory, blood lactate and muscle damage in male middle-distance runners.\n <p> \nMethods: Eighteen male middle-distance runners in a randomized and quasi experimental study\nwere allocated into two equal groups: supplement group (n=9, Coenzyme Q10: 5mg/kg/day) and\nplacebo group (n= 9, Dextrose: 5mg/kg/day). After acute (1day) and 14-day supplementation, all\nsubjects were participated in a training like running (competitive 3000 meters). Blood samples were\nobtained in the four phases: one hour before and 18-24 hours after two running protocols. Lactate,\nserum interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), C-reactive protein (CRP) and\ncreatine kinase (CK) were analyzed. Repeated ANOVA and Bonferuni as a post hoc tests were used\nto determine the changes in four stages. Differences between groups were determined by t-test.\n <p> \nResults: The results showed that acute and short-term Coenzyme Q10 supplementation had not\nsignificant effect on basal parameters. The acute coenzyme Q10 supplementation attenuated only the\nexercise-induced increase in response of the plasma CRP. The short-term (14-day) coenzyme Q10\nsupplementation attenuated the exercise-induced increase in response of the lactate, serum interleukin-\n6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and CRP in male middle-distance runners. However, the acute\nand short-term coenzyme Q10 supplementation had not any significant effect on the exerciseinduced\nincrease response of total serum creatine kinase.\n <p> \nConclusion: Based on the present results, it can be concluded that the 14-day coenzyme Q10 supplementation\n(5mg.kg-1.day-1) is more effective than the acute supplementation to overcome the\nexercise-induced adverse responses in some oxidative, inflammatory and biochemical parameters.\nTherefore, short-term coenzyme Q10 supplementation is recommended to reduce exercise-induced\nadverse consequences.\n\n\nFindings:\n[[\"14-day coenzyme Q10 supplementation (5mg.kg-1.day-1)\", \"acute supplementation of Q10\", \"overcome the exercise-induced adverse responses\", \"significantly increased\", \"Based on the present results, it can be concluded that the 14-day coenzyme Q10 supplementation\\r\\r\\r\\r\\n(5mg.kg-1.day-1) is more effective than the acute supplementation to overcome the\\r\\r\\r\\r\\nexercise-induced adverse responses in some oxidative, inflammatory and biochemical parameters.\\r\\r\\r\\r\\nTherefore, short-term coenzyme Q10 supplementation is recommended to reduce exercise-induced\\r\\r\\r\\r\\nadverse consequences.\"], [\"acute coenzyme Q10 supplementation \", \"placebo\", \"exercise-induced increase in response of the plasma CRP\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The acute coenzyme Q10 supplementation attenuated only the\\r\\r\\r\\r\\nexercise-induced increase in response of the plasma CRP.

Previous studies emphasized cellular immune responses; however, current research suggests both cellular and humoral responses are likely required for a successful therapeutic vaccine. Thus, we aimed to understand antibody response and function induced by vaccination of ART-treated HIV-1-infected patients with immune recovery. All subjects participated in EraMune 02, an open-label randomized clinical trial of ART intensification followed by a six plasmid DNA prime (envA, envB, envC, gagB, polB, nefB) and rAd5 boost HIV vaccine with matching inserts. Antibody binding levels were determined with a recently developed microarray approach. We also analyzed neutralization efficiency and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). We found that the DNA prime-rAd5 boost vaccine induced a significant cross-clade HIV-specific antibody response, which correlated with antibody neutralization efficiency. However, despite the increase in antibody binding levels, the vaccine did not significantly stimulate neutralization or ADCC responses. This finding was also reflected by a lack of change in total CD4+ cell associated HIV DNA in those who received the vaccine. Our results have important implications for further therapeutic vaccine design and administration, especially in HIV-1 infected patients, as boosting of preexisting antibody responses are unlikely to lead to clearance of latent proviruses in the HIV reservoir.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"DNA prime-rAd5 boost vaccine\", \"Control\", \"HIV-specific antibody response\", \"significantly increased\", \"We found that the DNA prime-rAd5 boost vaccine induced a significant cross-clade HIV-specific antibody response, which correlated with antibody neutralization efficiency.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

The purpose of present study was to determine the effect of acute and 14-day Coenzyme Q10\nsupplementation on inflammatory, blood lactate and muscle damage in male middle-distance runners.\n <p> \nMethods: Eighteen male middle-distance runners in a randomized and quasi experimental study\nwere allocated into two equal groups: supplement group (n=9, Coenzyme Q10: 5mg/kg/day) and\nplacebo group (n= 9, Dextrose: 5mg/kg/day). After acute (1day) and 14-day supplementation, all\nsubjects were participated in a training like running (competitive 3000 meters). Blood samples were\nobtained in the four phases: one hour before and 18-24 hours after two running protocols. Lactate,\nserum interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), C-reactive protein (CRP) and\ncreatine kinase (CK) were analyzed. Repeated ANOVA and Bonferuni as a post hoc tests were used\nto determine the changes in four stages. Differences between groups were determined by t-test.\n <p> \nResults: The results showed that acute and short-term Coenzyme Q10 supplementation had not\nsignificant effect on basal parameters. The acute coenzyme Q10 supplementation attenuated only the\nexercise-induced increase in response of the plasma CRP. The short-term (14-day) coenzyme Q10\nsupplementation attenuated the exercise-induced increase in response of the lactate, serum interleukin-\n6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and CRP in male middle-distance runners. However, the acute\nand short-term coenzyme Q10 supplementation had not any significant effect on the exerciseinduced\nincrease response of total serum creatine kinase.\n <p> \nConclusion: Based on the present results, it can be concluded that the 14-day coenzyme Q10 supplementation\n(5mg.kg-1.day-1) is more effective than the acute supplementation to overcome the\nexercise-induced adverse responses in some oxidative, inflammatory and biochemical parameters.\nTherefore, short-term coenzyme Q10 supplementation is recommended to reduce exercise-induced\nadverse consequences.\n\n\nFindings:\n[[\"14-day coenzyme Q10 supplementation (5mg.kg-1.day-1)\", \"acute supplementation of Q10\", \"overcome the exercise-induced adverse responses\", \"significantly increased\", \"Based on the present results, it can be concluded that the 14-day coenzyme Q10 supplementation\\r\\r\\r\\r\\n(5mg.kg-1.day-1) is more effective than the acute supplementation to overcome the\\r\\r\\r\\r\\nexercise-induced adverse responses in some oxidative, inflammatory and biochemical parameters.\\r\\r\\r\\r\\nTherefore, short-term coenzyme Q10 supplementation is recommended to reduce exercise-induced\\r\\r\\r\\r\\nadverse consequences.\"], [\"acute coenzyme Q10 supplementation \", \"placebo\", \"exercise-induced increase in response of the plasma CRP\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The acute coenzyme Q10 supplementation attenuated only the\\r\\r\\r\\r\\nexercise-induced increase in response of the plasma CRP.

Group 1 (experimental group) consisted of 20 (40 ears) individuals exposed to occupational noise with hearing thresholds within 25 dB HL. They were further divided into three subgroups based on duration of noise exposure (0–5 years of exposure-T1, 5–10 years of exposure-T2, and >10 years of exposure-T3). Group 2 (control group) consisted of 20 individuals (40 ears). Absolute latency and amplitude of waves I, III, and V were compared between the two groups for both click and CE-chirp stimuli. T1, T2, and T3 groups were compared for the same parameters to see the effect of noise exposure duration on CE-chirp and click ABR.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULT:: In Click ABR, while both the parameters for wave III were significantly poorer for the experimental group, wave V showed a significant decline in terms of amplitude only. There was no significant difference obtained for any of the parameters for wave I. In CE-Chirp ABR, the latencies for all three waves were significantly prolonged in the experimental group. However, there was a significant decrease in terms of amplitude in only wave V for the same group.\n\nABSTRACT.DISCUSSION:: Compared to click evoked ABR, CE-Chirp ABR was found to be more sensitive in comparison of latency parameters in individuals with occupational noise exposure. Monitoring of early pathological changes at the brainstem level can be studied effectively by using CE-Chirp stimulus in comparison to click stimulus.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: This study indicates that ABR's obtained with CE-chirp stimuli serves as an effective tool to identify the early pathological changes due to occupational noise exposure when compared to click evoked ABR.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"CE-chirp ABR\", \"click ABR\", \"wave I\", \"no significant difference\", \".

The objective of the Syndromic Surveillance Evaluation Study was to develop and implement standardized supports in local public health agencies in Ontario, Canada, and evaluate the ability of these supports to affect actions taken as part of public health communicable disease control programs.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Local public health agencies (LPHA) in Ontario, which used syndromic surveillance based on emergency department visits for respiratory disease, were recruited and randomly allocated to the study intervention or control group. The intervention group health agencies received standardized supports in terms of a standardized aberrant event detection algorithm and a response protocol dictating steps to investigate and assess the public health significance of syndromic surveillance alerts. The control group continued with their pre-existing syndromic surveillance infrastructure and processes. Outcomes were assessed using logbooks, which collected quantitative and qualitative information about alerts received, investigation steps taken, and public health responses. The study was conducted prospectively for 15 months (October 2013 to February 2015).\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Fifteen LPHAs participated in the study (n = 9 intervention group, n = 6 control group). A total of 1,969 syndromic surveillance alerts were received by all LPHAs. Variations in the types and amount of responses varied by LPHA, in particularly differences were noted by the size of the health unit. Smaller health units had more challenges to both detect and mount a response to any alerts. LPHAs in the control group were more likely to declare alerts to have public health significance and to initiate any action. Regression models using repeated measures showed an interaction between the year (Year 1 versus Year 2) and the intervention as well as an interaction between year and sustained nature of the alert. Both of these were linked to the control health units reporting more \"watchful waiting\".\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: This study raises questions about the effectiveness of using standardized protocols to improve the performance of syndromic surveillance in a decentralized public health system. Despite efforts to create standardized protocols and engage public health agencies in the process, no significant differences in the effective use of syndromic alerts were observed beyond year 1. It also raises questions about the minimum capacity of the agency and minimum population size that are required for an effective response.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Standardized aberrant event detection algorithm and response protocol\", \"Pre-existing syndromic surveillance infrastructure and processes\", \"Effective use of syndromic alerts after 1 year\", \"no significant difference\", \"Despite efforts to create standardized protocols and engage public health agencies in the process, no significant differences in the effective use of syndromic alerts were observed beyond year 1.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Group 1 (experimental group) consisted of 20 (40 ears) individuals exposed to occupational noise with hearing thresholds within 25 dB HL. They were further divided into three subgroups based on duration of noise exposure (0–5 years of exposure-T1, 5–10 years of exposure-T2, and >10 years of exposure-T3). Group 2 (control group) consisted of 20 individuals (40 ears). Absolute latency and amplitude of waves I, III, and V were compared between the two groups for both click and CE-chirp stimuli. T1, T2, and T3 groups were compared for the same parameters to see the effect of noise exposure duration on CE-chirp and click ABR.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULT:: In Click ABR, while both the parameters for wave III were significantly poorer for the experimental group, wave V showed a significant decline in terms of amplitude only. There was no significant difference obtained for any of the parameters for wave I. In CE-Chirp ABR, the latencies for all three waves were significantly prolonged in the experimental group. However, there was a significant decrease in terms of amplitude in only wave V for the same group.\n\nABSTRACT.DISCUSSION:: Compared to click evoked ABR, CE-Chirp ABR was found to be more sensitive in comparison of latency parameters in individuals with occupational noise exposure. Monitoring of early pathological changes at the brainstem level can be studied effectively by using CE-Chirp stimulus in comparison to click stimulus.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: This study indicates that ABR's obtained with CE-chirp stimuli serves as an effective tool to identify the early pathological changes due to occupational noise exposure when compared to click evoked ABR.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[[\"CE-chirp stimuli\", \"click stimuli\", \"latencies for all three waves\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The latencies for all three waves were significantly prolonged in the experimental group.

Furthermore, treatment with insulin in this group is frequently complicated by hypoglycaemia. In healthy patients and those with type 2 diabetes, exogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) decreases blood glucose by suppressing glucagon, stimulating insulin and slowing gastric emptying. Because the former effects are glucose-dependent, the use of GLP-1 is not associated with hypoglycaemia. The objective of this study was to establish if exogenous GLP-1 attenuates the glycaemic response to enteral nutrition in patients with critical illness induced hyperglycaemia.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Seven mechanically ventilated critically ill patients, not previously known to have diabetes, received two intravenous infusions of GLP-1 (1.2 pmol/kg/min) and placebo (4% albumin) over 270 minutes. Infusions were administered on consecutive days in a randomised, double-blind fashion. On both days a mixed nutrient liquid was infused, via a post-pyloric feeding catheter, at a rate of 1.5 kcal/min between 30 and 270 minutes. Blood glucose and plasma GLP-1, insulin and glucagon concentrations were measured.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: In all patients, exogenous GLP-1 infusion reduced the overall glycaemic response during enteral nutrient stimulation (AUC30–270 min GLP-1 (2077 ± 144 mmol/l min) vs placebo (2568 ± 208 mmol/l min); P = 0.02) and the peak blood glucose (GLP-1 (10.1 ± 0.7 mmol/l) vs placebo (12.7 ± 1.0 mmol/l); P < 0.01). The insulin/glucose ratio at 270 minutes was increased with GLP-1 infusion (GLP-1 (9.1 ± 2.7) vs. placebo (5.8 ± 1.8); P = 0.02) but there was no difference in absolute insulin concentrations. There was a transient, non-sustained, reduction in plasma glucagon concentrations during GLP-1 infusion (t = 30 minutes GLP-1 (90 ± 12 pmol/ml) vs. placebo (104 ± 10 pmol/ml); P < 0.01).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Acute, exogenous GLP-1 infusion markedly attenuates the glycaemic response to enteral nutrition in the critically ill. These observations suggest that GLP-1 and/or its analogues have the potential to manage hyperglycaemia in the critically ill.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry number: ACTRN12609000093280.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Exogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 infusion\", \"Control\", \"Peak blood glucose\", \"significantly decreased\", \"In all patients, exogenous GLP-1 infusion reduced the overall glycaemic response during enteral nutrient stimulation (AUC30\\u2013270 min GLP-1 (2077 \\u00b1 144 mmol/l min) vs placebo (2568 \\u00b1 208 mmol/l min); P = 0.02) and the peak blood glucose (GLP-1 (10.1 \\u00b1 0.7 mmol/l) vs placebo (12.7 \\u00b1 1.0 mmol/l); P \\u003c 0.01).\"], [\"Exogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 infusion\", \"Control\", \"Absolute insulin concentrations\", \"no significant difference\", \"The insulin/glucose ratio at 270 minutes was increased with GLP-1 infusion (GLP-1 (9.1 \\u00b1 2.7) vs. placebo (5.8 \\u00b1 1.8); P = 0.02) but there was no difference in absolute insulin concentrations.\"], [\"Exogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 infusion\", \"Control\", \"Glucagon concentrations during infusion\", \"significantly decreased\", \"There was a transient, non-sustained, reduction in plasma glucagon concentrations during GLP-1 infusion (t = 30 minutes GLP-1 (90 \\u00b1 12 pmol/ml) vs. placebo (104 \\u00b1 10 pmol/ml); P \\u003c 0.01).\"], [\"Exogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 infusion\", \"Control\", \"Glycaemic response\", \"significantly decreased\", \"In all patients, exogenous GLP-1 infusion reduced the overall glycaemic response during enteral nutrient stimulation (AUC30\\u2013270 min GLP-1 (2077 \\u00b1 144 mmol/l min) vs placebo (2568 \\u00b1 208 mmol/l min); P = 0.02) and the peak blood glucose (GLP-1 (10.1 \\u00b1 0.7 mmol/l) vs placebo (12.7 \\u00b1 1.0 mmol/l); P \\u003c 0.01).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Hence the use of balanced solutions could influence the inflammatory cascade triggered by the surgical procedures, the plasmatic electrolyte concentration, the acid–base equilibrium, and the renal function.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: This is a double blind randomized trial. Forty patients undergoing major abdominal surgery (bowel cancer) were allocated in two groups, the balanced solution (BS) group in which the fluids administered were balanced solutions (colloids and crystalloids); and the unbalanced solution (UBS) group in which the fluids administered were unbalanced solutions (colloids and crystalloids).

GDM patients were randomised to 2 groups per target glycaemic levels: GDM1 (tight glycaemic targets, fasting blood glucose < 5.1 mmol/L and <7.0 mmol/L postprandial, N = 20) and GDM2 (less tight glycaemic targets, <5.3 mmol/L and < 7.8 mmol/L, respectively, N = 21). The control group included 25 women with normal glucose tolerance. ANGPTL4 expression was decreased in the HUVECs from GDM patients versus the control group (23.11 ± 5.71, 21.47 ± 5.64, and 98.33 ± 20.92, for GDM1, GDM2, and controls; p < 0.001) with no difference between GDM1 and GDM2. The level of adiponectin gene expression was low and did not differ among the groups. Leptin gene expression was undetectable in HUVECs. In cord blood, leptin/adiponectin ratio (LAR) was increased in GDM2 compared to controls and GDM1 (p = 0.038) and did not differ between GDM1 and controls. Tight glycaemic targets were associated with normalisation of increased LAR in the cord blood.

Hence the use of balanced solutions could influence the inflammatory cascade triggered by the surgical procedures, the plasmatic electrolyte concentration, the acid–base equilibrium, and the renal function.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: This is a double blind randomized trial. Forty patients undergoing major abdominal surgery (bowel cancer) were allocated in two groups, the balanced solution (BS) group in which the fluids administered were balanced solutions (colloids and crystalloids); and the unbalanced solution (UBS) group in which the fluids administered were unbalanced solutions (colloids and crystalloids). Measurements were performed after anaesthesia induction (T0), at the end of surgery (T1), within 2 h after surgery (T2) and 24 h after the beginning of surgery (T3). The following data were collected: 1) active matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and its tissue inhibitor (TIMP-1), IL-6, IL-8, IL-10; 2) blood gases variables; 3) electrolytes, albumin, total serum protein and the strong ion difference; 4) neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) from urinary sample.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The BS group exhibited higher circulating level of IL-10 and TIMP-1 and lower level of active MMP-9.

Outpatient IOL is an attractive option to reduce these impacts. To date there is little data comparing outpatient and inpatient IOL methods, and potential safety concerns (hyperstimulation) if prostaglandins, the standard inpatient IOL medications, are used in the outpatient setting. The purpose of this study was to assess feasibility, clinical effectiveness and patient acceptability of outpatient Foley catheter (OPC) vs. inpatient vaginal PGE2 (IP) for induction of labour (IOL) at term.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Women with an unfavourable cervix requiring IOL at term (N = 101) were randomised to outpatient care using Foley catheter (OPC, n = 50) or inpatient care using vaginal PGE2 (IP, n = 51). OPC group had Foley catheter inserted and were discharged overnight following a reassuring cardiotocograph. IP group received 2 mg/1 mg vaginal PGE2 if nulliparous or 1 mg/1 mg if multiparous. Main outcome measures were inpatient stay (prior to birth, in Birthing Unit, total), mode of birth, induction to delivery interval, adverse reactions and patient satisfaction.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: OPC group had shorter hospital stay prior to birth (21.3 vs. 32.4 hrs, p < .001), IP were more likely to achieve vaginal birth within 12 hours of presenting to Birthing Unit (53% vs. 28%, p = .01). Vaginal birth rates (66% OPC Vs. 71% IP), total induction to delivery time (33.5 hrs vs. 31.3 hrs) and total inpatient times (96 hrs OPC Vs. 105 hrs IP) were similar. OPC group felt less pain (significant discomfort 26% Vs 58%, p = .003), and had more sleep (5.8 Vs 3.4 hours, p < .001), during cervical preparation, but were more likely to require oxytocin IOL (88 Vs 59%, p = .001).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: OPC was feasible and acceptable for IOL of women with an unfavourable cervix at term compared to IP, however did not show a statistically significant reduction in total inpatient stay and was associated with increased oxytocin IOL.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN:12609000420246.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Outpatient Foley catheter\", \"Inpatient vaginal PGE2\", \"Vaginal birth rate\", \"no significant difference\", \"Vaginal birth rates (66% OPC Vs. 71% IP), total induction to delivery time (33.5 hrs vs. 31.3 hrs) and total inpatient times (96 hrs OPC Vs. 105 hrs IP) were similar.\"], [\"Outpatient Foley catheter\", \"Inpatient vaginal PGE2\", \"Induction to delivery time\", \"no significant difference\", \").

Interestingly, the patients' suicidal ideation scale was negatively correlated with KPS (r =−0.29, P<0.05).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: For individuals diagnosed with a malignant tumor, using a mental health clinical nursing pathway can effectively decrease the degree of suicidal ideation and positively impact the quality of life.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"mental clinical nursing pathway care\", \"usual nursing care\", \"suicidal ideation scale\", \"significantly decreased\", \"the former four factors of patients in the study group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.01)\"],\n    [\"mental clinical nursing pathway care\", \"usual nursing care\", \"Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS)\", \"significantly increased\", \"the KPS of patients receiving mental clinical nursing pathway care was higher than those receiving usual nursing care, and there was a statistical significant difference between the two groups (P<0.01)\"],\n    [\"mental clinical nursing pathway care\", \"usual nursing care\", \"despair factor\", \"significantly decreased\", \"the former four factors of patients in the study group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.01)\"],\n    [\"mental clinical nursing pathway care\", \"usual nursing care\", \"optimistic factor\", \"significantly decreased\", \"the former four factors of patients in the study group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.01)\"],\n    [\"mental clinical nursing pathway care\", \"usual nursing care\", \"sleep factor\", \"significantly decreased\", \"the former four factors of patients in the study group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.01)\"],\n    [\"mental clinical nursing pathway care\", \"usual nursing care\", \"cover factor\", \"no significant difference\", \"there were no significant differences in the score of cover factor between the two groups (P>0.05)\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"mental clinical nursing pathway care\", \"usual nursing care\", \"suicidal ideation scale\", \"significantly decreased\", \"the former four factors of patients in the study group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.01)\"],\n    [\"mental clinical nursing pathway care\", \"usual nursing care\", \"Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS)\", \"significantly increased\", \"the KPS of patients receiving mental clinical nursing pathway care was higher than those receiving usual nursing care, and there was a statistical significant difference between the two groups (P<0.01)\"],\n    [\"mental clinical nursing pathway care\", \"usual nursing care\", \"despair factor\", \"significantly decreased\", \"the former four factors of patients in the study group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.01)\"],\n    [\"mental clinical nursing pathway care\", \"usual nursing care\", \"optimistic factor\", \"significantly decreased\", \"the former four factors of patients in the study group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.01)\"],\n    [\"mental clinical nursing pathway care\", \"usual nursing care\", \"sleep factor\", \"significantly decreased\", \"the former four factors of patients in the study group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.01)\"],\n    [\"mental clinical nursing pathway care\", \"usual nursing care\", \"cover factor\", \"no significant difference\", \"there were no significant differences in the score of cover factor between the two groups (P>0.05)\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "00998bd0b749a2c77706ce3ef89095ae064ef3772e337a283ae456beed74e7ff", "prompt_hash": "64c9066e92f7c1778a503c7473031926e2cf52e792f161bea20b174187bdab75", "target_hash": "3cdfaac21aee5e7adc8e5730a3d2fa437221ac1635987f8bc2e8b4514aaacbdd", "bypass": null}

A patient-level meta-analysis of the studies enabled these endpoints to be examined over 6 months in a large population with T2DM (Gla-300, n = 1247; Gla-100, n = 1249).\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: No significant study-by-treatment interactions across studies were found, enabling them to be pooled. The mean change in glycated haemoglobin was comparable for Gla-300 and Gla-100 [each −1.02 (standard error 0.03)%; least squares (LS) mean difference 0.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) −0.08 to 0.07)%].

We aimed to investigate if intake of orange juice with or in-between meals differently affects energy balance or metabolic risk. Twenty-six healthy adults (24.7 ± 3.2 y; BMI 23.2 ± 3.2 kg/m2) participated in a 4-week cross-over intervention and consumed orange juice (20% of energy requirement) either together with 3 meals/d (WM) or in-between 3 meals/d (BM) at ad libitum energy intake. Basal and postprandial insulin sensitivity (primary outcome), daylong glycaemia, glucose variability and insulin secretion were assessed. Body fat mass was measured by air-displacement plethysmography. After BM-intervention, fat mass increased (+1.0 ± 1.8 kg; p < 0.05) and postprandial insulin sensitivity tended to decrease (ΔMatsudaISI: −0.89 ± 2.3; p = 0.06).

To evaluate the efficacy of epoetin-α prior to revision total knee arthroplasty, we hypothesized that epoetin-α will reduce blood transfusion. Methods. Eighty-one patients were compared in this retrospective review; twenty-eight patients received our dosing regimen. All patients were mildly anemic. Epoetin-α to control (1 : 2) patient matching occurred so that one of two attending surgeons, gender, BMI, complexity of surgery, ASA score, and age were similar between groups. The clinical triggers for blood transfusion during or after the procedure were determined based on peri- and postoperative hemoglobin levels, ASA score, and/or clinical symptoms consistent with anemia. Blood salvage was not used. Results. Blood transfusion and length of stay were lower in the study group. None of the patients who received epoetin-α underwent transfusion. Hemoglobin increased from 11.97 to 13.8, preoperatively. Hemoglobin at day of surgery and time of discharge were higher. Gender, BMI, ASA score, total and hidden blood losses, calculated blood loss, preop PLT, PT, PTT, and INR were similar between groups. One Epogen patient had an uncomplicated DVT (3.6%). Conclusions. Epoetin-α may have a role in the mildly anemic revision knee patient. It may also decrease patient length of stay allowing for earlier readiness to resume normal activities and/or meet short-term milestones. A randomized study to evaluate the direct and indirect costs of such a treatment methodology in the mildly anemic revision patient may be warranted.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"epoetin-\\u03b1\", \"control\", \"average total blood loss\", \"no significant difference\", \"Gender, BMI, ASA score, total and hidden blood losses, calculated blood loss, preop PLT, PT, PTT, and INR were similar between groups.\"], [\"epoetin-\\u03b1\", \"control\", \"hidden blood loss\", \"no significant difference\", \"Gender, BMI, ASA score, total and hidden blood losses, calculated blood loss, preop PLT, PT, PTT, and INR were similar between groups.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

We aimed to investigate if intake of orange juice with or in-between meals differently affects energy balance or metabolic risk. Twenty-six healthy adults (24.7 ± 3.2 y; BMI 23.2 ± 3.2 kg/m2) participated in a 4-week cross-over intervention and consumed orange juice (20% of energy requirement) either together with 3 meals/d (WM) or in-between 3 meals/d (BM) at ad libitum energy intake. Basal and postprandial insulin sensitivity (primary outcome), daylong glycaemia, glucose variability and insulin secretion were assessed. Body fat mass was measured by air-displacement plethysmography. After BM-intervention, fat mass increased (+1.0 ± 1.8 kg; p < 0.05) and postprandial insulin sensitivity tended to decrease (ΔMatsudaISI: −0.89 ± 2.3; p = 0.06). By contrast, after WM-intervention fat mass and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) decreased (−0.30 ± 0.65 kg; −2.50 ± 3.94; both p < 0.05), whereas glucose variability was higher (ΔMAGE: +0.45 ± 0.59, p < 0.05). Daylong glycaemia, insulin secretion, changes in basal insulin sensitivity, and triglycerides did not differ between WM- and BM-interventions (all p > 0.05). In young healthy adults, a conventional 3-meal structure with orange juice consumed together with meals had a favorable impact on energy balance, whereas juice consumption in-between meals may contribute to a gain in body fat and adverse metabolic effects.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"orange juice\", \"null\", \"fat mass\", \"significantly increased\", \"After BM-intervention, fat mass increased (+1.0 ± 1.8 kg; p < 0.05).\"],\n    [\"orange juice\", \"null\", \"postprandial insulin sensitivity\", \"significantly decreased\", \"After BM-intervention, postprandial insulin sensitivity tended to decrease (ΔMatsudaISI: −0.89 ± 2.3; p = 0.06).\"],\n    [\"orange juice\", \"null\", \"body fat mass\", \"significantly decreased\", \"By contrast, after WM-intervention fat mass decreased (−0.30 ± 0.65 kg; p < 0.05).\"],\n    [\"orange juice\", \"null\", \"gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)\", \"significantly decreased\", \"By contrast, after WM-intervention gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) decreased (−2.50 ± 3.94; p < 0.05).\"],\n    [\"orange juice\", \"null\", \"glucose variability\", \"significantly increased\", \"By contrast, after WM-intervention glucose variability was higher (ΔMAGE: +0.45 ± 0.59, p < 0.05).\"],\n    [\"orange juice\", \"null\", \"triglycerides\", \"no significant difference\", \"Daylong glycaemia, insulin secretion, changes in basal insulin sensitivity, and triglycerides did not differ between WM- and BM-interventions (all p > 0.05).\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"orange juice\", \"null\", \"fat mass\", \"significantly increased\", \"After BM-intervention, fat mass increased (+1.0 ± 1.8 kg; p < 0.05).\"],\n    [\"orange juice\", \"null\", \"postprandial insulin sensitivity\", \"significantly decreased\", \"After BM-intervention, postprandial insulin sensitivity tended to decrease (ΔMatsudaISI: −0.89 ± 2.3; p = 0.06).\"],\n    [\"orange juice\", \"null\", \"body fat mass\", \"significantly decreased\", \"By contrast, after WM-intervention fat mass decreased (−0.30 ± 0.65 kg; p < 0.05).\"],\n    [\"orange juice\", \"null\", \"gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)\", \"significantly decreased\", \"By contrast, after WM-intervention gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) decreased (−2.50 ± 3.94; p < 0.05).\"],\n    [\"orange juice\", \"null\", \"glucose variability\", \"significantly increased\", \"By contrast, after WM-intervention glucose variability was higher (ΔMAGE: +0.45 ± 0.59, p < 0.05).\"],\n    [\"orange juice\", \"null\", \"triglycerides\", \"no significant difference\", \"Daylong glycaemia, insulin secretion, changes in basal insulin sensitivity, and triglycerides did not differ between WM- and BM-interventions (all p > 0.05).\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "835dd3e3b5fdb0886e890d846a988e895d14b78549144f6462e9297616f746f7", "prompt_hash": "1b78aaef5d7d03c62b86bd4615d1e6e811198deff9c59a8717db5be573660a70", "target_hash": "42ab4e9df9f22c75f0b35df2121a27e1c006fee529327c2bc40d0ce1f976e669", "bypass": null}

Promising results of calcitriol supplementation in studies aiming space flight induced osteoporosis is little and the effect of this hormone on biomarkers of bone metabolism is not examined yet in space flight models of osteoporosis in rats.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: This was an interventional animal study being performed in a 1-month period. We included 21 Sprague Dawley strain rats (>200 gr, >6 week) who were randomly assigned to receive daily supplementation of oral 0.03μgr calcitriol and to be submitted to tail suspension model. Rats were followed for 1 month and were tested for serum osteocalcin (OC), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and serum calcium at the beginning and the end of the study period. The results were analyzed and compared between groups.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Although serum levels of osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase biomarkers and total serum calcium were not significantly different within and between study groups, their levels were increased in tail suspension model compared to control group. The levels of these biomarkers were lower in those who were submitted to tail suspension model and received calcitriol supplementation compared to those who were only submitted to tail suspension (60.14 ± 11.73 ng/mL vs. 58.29 ± 2.69 ng/mL; p = 0.696 for osteocalcin and 381.86 ± 99.16 mU/mL vs. 362.57 ± 27.41 ng/mL; p = 0.635 for alkaline phosphatase).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Supplementation of daily diet with calcitriol in rats under weightlessness conditions may results in lower values for bone metabolic biomarkers of alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin and serum calcium. This pattern of change in biomarkers of bone formation, may point to the capacity of calcitriol supplementation in preventing cellular process of osteoporosis. Thus calcitriol supplementation could be an available, economic and effective strategy for preventing bone metabolic changes related to weightlessness commonly encountered in space flight.

Given that immigrant parents and children are at greater risk for becoming overweight/obese with increased time in the US, identification of risk factors for weight gain is critical.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Baseline data was collected on 383 mother-child dyads enrolled in Live Well, a community-based, participatory, randomized controlled lifestyle intervention to prevent weight gain in recent immigrant mothers. Socio-demographic information together with heights and weights were collected for both mother and child. Acculturation, behavioral data, and responses to the Caregiver's Feeding Styles Questionnaire (CFSQ) were also obtained from the mother.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The children's average age was 6.2 ± 2.7 years, 58% male. Mothers had been in the country for an average of 6.0 ± 3.3 years, and are Brazilian (36%), Haitian (34%) and Latino (30%). Seventy-two percent of the mothers were overweight/obese, while 43% of the children were overweight/obese. Fifteen percent of mothers reported their feeding style as being high demanding/high responsive; 32% as being high demanding/low responsive; 34% as being low demanding/high responsive and 18% as being low demanding/low responsive. In bivariate analyses, feeding styles significantly differed by child BMIz-score, ethnic group, and mother's perceived stress. In multiple linear regression, a low demanding/high responsive feeding style was found to be positively associated (ß = 0.56) with a higher child weight as compared to high demanding/high responsive, controlling for known covariates (p = 0.01).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Most mothers report having a low demanding/high responsive feeding style, which is associated with higher child weight status in this diverse immigrant population. This finding adds to the growing literature that suggests this type of feeding style may be a risk factor for childhood obesity. Further research is needed to help understand the larger socio-cultural context and its influence on feeding dynamics among immigrant families and families of lower incomes. How parents establish a certain feeding style in their home country compared to when they move to the US \"obesogenic\" environment, should also be explored.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"low demanding/high responsive feeding style\", \"high demanding/high responsive feeding style\", \"child weight\", \"significantly increased\", \"In multiple linear regression, a low demanding/high responsive feeding style was found to be positively associated (\\u00df = 0.56) with a higher child weight as compared to high demanding/high responsive, controlling for known covariates (p = 0.01).\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:161"}, "target": "[[\"low demanding/high responsive feeding style\", \"high demanding/high responsive feeding style\", \"child weight\", \"significantly increased\", \"In multiple linear regression, a low demanding/high responsive feeding style was found to be positively associated (\\u00df = 0.56) with a higher child weight as compared to high demanding/high responsive, controlling for known covariates (p = 0.01).\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

However, they may, in turn, also influence behavioral adherence and success in weight loss. The present study examined associations among obesity treatment-related variables, i.e., change in weight, quality of life, body image, and subjective well-being, exploring their role as both mediators and outcomes, during a behavioral obesity treatment.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Participants (BMI = 31.1 ± 4.1 kg/m2; age = 38.4 ± 6.7 y) were 144 women who attended a 12-month obesity treatment program and a comparison group (n = 49), who received a general health education program. The intervention included regular group meetings promoting lasting behavior changes in physical activity and dietary intake. Body image, quality of life, subjective well-being, and body weight were measured at baseline and treatment's end. Mediation was tested by multiple regression and a resampling approach to measure indirect effects. Treatment group assignment was the independent variable while changes in weight and in psychosocial variables were analyzed alternatively as mediators and as dependent variables.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: At 12 months, the intervention group had greater weight loss (-5.6 ± 6.8% vs. -1.2 ± 4.6%, p < .001) and larger decreases in body size dissatisfaction (effect size of 1.08 vs. .41, p < .001) than the comparison group. Significant improvements were observed in both groups for all other psychosocial variables (effect sizes ranging from .31–.75, p < .05). Mediation analysis showed that changes in body image and body weight were concurrently mediators and outcomes of treatment, suggesting reciprocal influences. Weight loss partially mediated the effect of treatment on quality of life and on self-esteem but the reciprocal effect was not observed.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Changes in weight and body image may reciprocally affect each other during the course of behavioral obesity treatment. No evidence of reciprocal relationships was found for the other models under analysis; however, weight changes partially explained the effects of treatment on quality of life and self-esteem. Weight and psychosocial changes co-occur during treatment and will probably influence each other dynamically, in ways not yet adequately understood.

Telemonitoring has been proposed as a solution to this growing problem, but its impact on patient outcome is equivocal. This randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate effectiveness of telemonitoring in improving COPD patient outcome. In total, 106 subjects were randomly assigned to the telemonitoring (n = 53) or usual care (n = 53) group. During the two months following discharge, telemonitoring group patients had to report their symptoms daily using an electronic diary. The primary outcome measure was time to first re-admission for COPD exacerbation within six months of discharge. During the follow-up period, time to first re-admission for COPD exacerbation was significantly increased in the telemonitoring group than in the usual care group (p = 0.026). Telemonitoring was also associated with a reduced number of all-cause re-admissions (0.23 vs. 0.68/patient; p = 0.002) and emergency room visits (0.36 vs. 0.91/patient; p = 0.006). In conclusion, telemonitoring intervention was associated with improved outcomes among COPD patients admitted for exacerbation in a country characterized by a small territory and high accessibility to medical services. The findings are encouraging and add further support to implementation of telemonitoring as part of COPD care.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"telemonitoring group\", \"usual group\", \"ER visits for all causes\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Telemonitoring was also associated with a reduced number of all-cause re-admissions (0.23 vs. 0.68/patient; p = 0.002) and emergency room visits (0.36 vs. 0.91/patient; p = 0.006).\"], [\"telemonitoring group\", \"usual group\", \"the time to first re-admission for COPD exacerbation\", \"significantly increased\", \", time to first re-admission for COPD exacerbation was significantly increased in the telemonitoring group than in the usual care group (p = 0.026).\"], [\"telemonitoring group\", \"usual group\", \"the number of all-cause re-admissions over a period of six months\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Telemonitoring was also associated with a reduced number of all-cause re-admissions (0.23 vs. 0.68/patient; p = 0.002) and emergency room visits (0.36 vs. 0.91/patient; p = 0.006)\"], [\"telemonitoring group\", \"usual group\", \"episodes of COPD-related re-admissions or ER visits per capita\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Telemonitoring was also associated with a reduced number of all-cause re-admissions (0.23 vs. 0.68/patient; p = 0.002) and emergency room visits (0.36 vs. 0.91/patient; p = 0.006).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Outcomes included infant activity (tummy time, unrestrained floor time, time in movement restricting devices). Health literacy assessed using the Newest Vital Sign.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: 456 mothers completed 3-month assessments. Infant activity: 82.6% ever practiced tummy time; 32.0% practiced tummy time on the floor; 34.4% reported unrestrained floor time; 56.4% reported >1 hour/day in movement restricting devices. Inadequate health literacy was associated with reduced tummy time and unrestrained floor time. The intervention group reported more floor tummy time (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.44–3.23) and unrestrained floor time (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.14–2.49) compared to controls.

This receptor profile makes it possible for it to act as a dopamine system stabilizer. Based on various short term and long term studies, aripiprazole has been found to be effective in schizophrenia and has no significant adverse effect on QTc prolongation, prolactin, serum lipids, and has a low potential for weight gain. Present study aims to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of aripiprazole (10-15mg/day) in the treatment of Indian patients of schizophrenia and to see its effect on QTc interval, prolactin levels, serum lipids, plasma sugar and weight gain in these patients. Outpatients with an ongoing/newly diagnosed ICD-10 Schizophrenia (n=136) were randomly assigned to 10 or 15 mg dose of Aripiprazole for a period of six weeks. Clinical response was evaluated by the Positive And Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS), Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale and safety was evaluated by observing spontaneously reported adverse events and changes in various laboratory parameters. Switching schizophrenic patients to aripiprazole (10/15 mg) from both conventional and atypical anti-psychotics was safe and well tolerated. Six weeks after switching to aripiprazole, patients showed improvements in PANSS scores (P< 0.001), EPS, prolactin levels and weight over the baseline levels. No difference was seen in the 10 or 15mg dose groups. One hospitalization was reported (due to hepatitis E). Common side effects reported were insomnia, somnolence, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.

Protocols of post-partum pain management should be planned based on the facilities of each center or region. The aim of current study was to compare the analgesic efficacy of oral methadone and intra muscular (IM) pethidine which the latter was routinely used in our center in post cesarean pain treatment.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:: In this prospective double-blind clinical trial, women who were candidate for cesarean section were selected and randomized into two groups. All patients routinely received a single IM pethidine dose (50 mg) after CS in the recovery room. One group of patients received 0.7 mg/kg pethidine every 6 hour IM, and another group received 0.07 mg/kg oral methadone every 6 hour. Severity of pain assessed using visual analogue scale (VAS) score in 6, 12, 18 and 24 hour after surgery.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: Pain severity in methadone group at 6, 12, 18 and 24 hour post operation were 6.4 ± 0.9, 3.4 ± 0.8, 1.9 ± 1.1, 0.5 ± 0.5 (p < 0.05) and for patients in pethidine group were 6.6 ± 0.8, 3.4 ± 0.9, 2.1 ± 1.0 and 0.5 ± 0.5 (p < 0.05), respectively (Mean ± SD). Between groups differences in each follow up time were not statistically significant. There was no difference between groups in terms of complications and supplementary analgesic use.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: Considering the similar analgesic effects of methadone and pethidine, satisfaction of patients and nursing system with methadone use and the cost benefit of methadone, it can be recommended to use methadone for post operative pain relieving.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"0.7 mg/kg pethidine every 6 hour IM\", \"0.07 mg/kg oral methadone every 6 hour.\", \"Pain severity\", \"no significant difference\", \"Pain severity in methadone group at 6, 12, 18 and 24 hour post operation were 6.4 \\u00b1 0.9, 3.4 \\u00b1 0.8, 1.9 \\u00b1 1.1, 0.5 \\u00b1 0.5 (p \\u0026lt; 0.05) and for patients in pethidine group were 6.6 \\u00b1 0.8, 3.4 \\u00b1 0.9, 2.1 \\u00b1 1.0 and 0.5 \\u00b1 0.5 (p \\u0026lt; 0.05), respectively (Mean \\u00b1 SD).

Artiflex was inserted in 20 eyes and ICL in the other 20 eyes. After 1 year, uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), contrast sensitivity, intraocular pressure (IOP), and specular microscopy of corneal endothelium were assessed in both the groups.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: In this study, there was no statistical difference between UCVA, BCVA, IOP, cataract incidence, contrast sensitivity, and specular microscopy, 1 year after surgery. 40% of eyes in the Artiflex group developed anterior chamber cell and flare reaction 1 year postoperatively, but no patient in the ICL group developed the same. So, there is obvious difference in the rate of anterior chamber cell and flare reaction between these two groups.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: These two lenses have similar outcomes except in the incidence rate of anterior chamber cell and flare reaction that is greater in the Artiflex group.

This study aimed to design and implement an empowerment educational intervention to prevent elder abuse.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: This parallel randomized controlled trial was conducted in 2014–2016 for 18 months on 464 older adults aged above 60 years who visited health houses of 22 municipalities in Tehran. Data were collected using standard questionnaires, including the Elder Abuse-Knowledge Questionnaire, Health-Promoting Behavior Questionnaire, Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II, Barriers to Healthy Lifestyle, Perceived Social Support, Perceived Self-Efficacy, Loneliness Scale, Geriatric Depression Scale, Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale, and the SCARED (stress, coping, argument, resources, events, and dependence) tool. The intervention was done in twenty 45- to 60-minute training sessions over 6 months. Data analysis were performed using χ2 tests, multiple linear and logistic regression, and structural equation modeling (SEM).\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The frequency of knowledge of elder abuse, self-efficacy, social support and health promoting lifestyle before the intervention was similar in the two groups. However, the frequency of high knowledge of elder abuse (94.8% in the intervention group and 46.6% in the control group), high self-efficacy (82.8% and 7.8%, respectively), high social support (97.0% and 10.3%, respectively) and high health promoting lifestyle (97.0% and 10.3%, respectively) was significantly higher (P<0.001) and the frequency of elder abuse risk (28.0% and 49.6%, respectively) was significantly less in the intervention group after the intervention. SEM standardized beta (Sβ) showed that the intervention had the highest impact on increase social support (Sβ=0.80, β=48.64, SE=1.70, P<0.05), self-efficacy (Sβ=0.76, β=13.32, SE=0.52, P<0.05) and health promoting behaviors (Sβ=0.48, β=33.08, SE=2.26, P<0.05), respectively. The effect of the intervention on decrease of elder abuse risk was indirect and significant (Sβ=−0.406, β=−0.340, SE=0.03, P<0.05), and through social support, self-efficacy, and health promoting behaviors.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Educational interventions can be effective in preventing elder abuse.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"intervention group\", \"control group\", \"The frequency of knowledge of elder abuse after the intervention\", \"significantly increased\", \"However, the frequency of high knowledge of elder abuse (94.8% in the intervention group and 46.6% in the control group), high self-efficacy (82.8% and 7.8%, respectively), high social support (97.0% and 10.3%, respectively) and high health promoting lifestyle (97.0% and 10.3%, respectively) was significantly higher (P\\u003c0.001) and the frequency of elder abuse risk (28.0% and 49.6%, respectively) was significantly less in the intervention group after the intervention.\"], [\"intervention group\", \"control group\", \"The frequency of health promoting lifestyle after the intervention\", \"significantly increased\", \"However, the frequency of high knowledge of elder abuse (94.8% in the intervention group and 46.6% in the control group), high self-efficacy (82.8% and 7.8%, respectively), high social support (97.0% and 10.3%, respectively) and high health promoting lifestyle (97.0% and 10.3%, respectively) was significantly higher (P\\u003c0.001) and the frequency of elder abuse risk (28.0% and 49.6%, respectively) was significantly less in the intervention group after the intervention.\"], [\"intervention group\", \"control group\", \"The frequency of social support after the intervention\", \"significantly increased\", \"However, the frequency of high knowledge of elder abuse (94.8% in the intervention group and 46.6% in the control group), high self-efficacy (82.8% and 7.8%, respectively), high social support (97.0% and 10.3%, respectively) and high health promoting lifestyle (97.0% and 10.3%, respectively) was significantly higher (P\\u003c0.001) and the frequency of elder abuse risk (28.0% and 49.6%, respectively) was significantly less in the intervention group after the intervention.\"], [\"intervention group\", \"control group\", \"The frequency of self-efficacy after the intervention\", \"significantly increased\", \".

Artiflex was inserted in 20 eyes and ICL in the other 20 eyes. After 1 year, uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), contrast sensitivity, intraocular pressure (IOP), and specular microscopy of corneal endothelium were assessed in both the groups.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: In this study, there was no statistical difference between UCVA, BCVA, IOP, cataract incidence, contrast sensitivity, and specular microscopy, 1 year after surgery. 40% of eyes in the Artiflex group developed anterior chamber cell and flare reaction 1 year postoperatively, but no patient in the ICL group developed the same. So, there is obvious difference in the rate of anterior chamber cell and flare reaction between these two groups.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: These two lenses have similar outcomes except in the incidence rate of anterior chamber cell and flare reaction that is greater in the Artiflex group. So, these two lenses are safe with predictable outcome in treating high myopia.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[[\"Artiflex\", \"ICL\", \"the rate of anterior chamber cell and flare reaction\", \"significantly increased\", \"40% of eyes in the Artiflex group developed anterior chamber cell and flare reaction 1 year postoperatively, but no patient in the ICL group developed the same.\"]]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[[\"Artiflex\", \"ICL\", \"the rate of anterior chamber cell and flare reaction\", \"significantly increased\", \"40% of eyes in the Artiflex group developed anterior chamber cell and flare reaction 1 year postoperatively, but no patient in the ICL group developed the same.\"]]"], "doc_hash": "c2798cdff7036f505334b68fc2ea0e47b0dec513502112e0a1806d2e70abc998", "prompt_hash": "de8174dda531056c22fa53eb3943e72d0a63a43f143d5cc9745ffadfe9c8daa3", "target_hash": "ff28b6c4650932cfad1c104e660c7a0c19afdc448e1fa2fc9c2b9e655749f88d", "bypass": null}

The number of circulating endothelial cells (CECs) is a surrogate marker for endothelial damage.

The primary outcome was to compare post operative pain and range of motion (ROM). The secondary outcome was to measure the duration of surgery, blood loss, chair rise test, quadriceps strength, anterior knee pain, Knee Society Score (KSS),WOMAC scores, mechanical leg axis and component alignment.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Patients in the MIS group (3.97 ± 2.16) had significant more pain at 2 weeks than patients in the conventional group (2.77 ± 1.43) p = 0.003. There was no significant difference in any of the other primary outcome parameters. Surgery time was significantly longer (p < 0.001) and there were significantly higher blood loss (p = 0.002) in the MIS group as compared to the conventional group. The difference of the mean mechanical leg alignment between the groups was not statistically significant (–0.43° (95 % CI –1.50 – 0.64); p = 0.43). <p> There was no significant difference of component alignment between the two surgical groups with respect to flexion/extension (p = 0.269), varus/valgus (p = 0.653) or rotational alignment (p = 0.485) of the femur component and varus valgus alignment (p = 0.778) or posterior slope (p = 0.164) of the tibial component.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: There was no advantage of the MIS approach compared to a conventional approach CAS-TKA in any of the primary outcome measurements assessed, however the MIS approach was associated with longer surgical time and greater blood loss.

However, impaired airway clearance is associated with NIV failure. Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) has been proven to be very effective in patients receiving NIV. We aimed to assess the efficacy of MI-E as part of an extubation protocol.\n\nABSTRACT.METHOD: Patients with mechanical ventilation (MV) for more than 48 hours with specific inclusion criteria, who successfully tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), were randomly allocated before extubation, either for (A) a conventional extubation protocol (control group), or (B) the MI-E extubation protocol (study group). During the postextubation period (48 hours), group A patients received standard medical treatment (SMT), including NIV in case of specific indications, whereas group B received the same postextubation approach plus three daily sessions of mechanical in-exsufflation (MI-E). Reintubation rates, ICU length of stay, and NIV failure rates were analyzed.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Seventy-five patients (26 women) with a mean age of 61.8 ± 17.3 years were randomized to a control group (n = 40; mean SAPS II, 47.8 ± 17.7) and to a study group (n = 35; mean SAPS II, 45.0 ± 15.0). MV time before enrollment was 9.4 ± 4.8 and 10.5 ± 4.1 days for the control and the study group, respectively. In the 48 hours after extubation, 20 control patients (50%) and 14 study patients (40%) used NIV. Study group patients had a significant lower reintubation rate than did controls; six patients (17%) versus 19 patients (48%), P < 0.05; respectively, and a significantly lower time under MV; 17.8 ± 6.4 versus 11.7 ± 3.5 days; P < 0.05; respectively. Considering only the subgroup of patients that used NIV, the reintubation rates related to NIV failure were significantly lower in the study group when compared with controls; two patients (6%) versus 13 (33%); P < 0.05, respectively.

We developed a highly-structured manualized eight-session cognitive-behavioral program with a focus on subthreshold depression in the workplace and to be administered via telephone by trained psychotherapists (tCBT).\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: We conducted a parallel-group, non-blinded randomized controlled trial of tCBT in addition to the pre-existing Employee Assistance Program (EAP) versus EAP alone among workers with subthreshold depression at a large manufacturing company in Japan. The primary outcomes were depression severity as measured with Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and presenteeism as measured with World Health Organization Health and Work Productivity Questionnaire (HPQ). In the course of the trial the follow-up period was shortened in order to increase acceptability of the study.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The planned sample size was 108 per arm but the trial was stopped early due to low accrual. Altogether 118 subjects were randomized to tCBT+EAP (n = 58) and to EAP alone (n = 60). The BDI-II scores fell from the mean of 17.3 at baseline to 11.0 in the intervention group and to 15.7 in the control group after 4 months (p<0.001, Effect size = 0.69, 95%CI: 0.32 to 1.05). However, there was no statistically significant decrease in absolute and relative presenteeism (p = 0.44, ES = 0.15, −0.21 to 0.52, and p = 0.50, ES = 0.02, −0.34 to 0.39, respectively).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Remote CBT, including tCBT, may provide easy access to quality-assured effective psychotherapy for people in the work force who present with subthreshold depression.

However, impaired airway clearance is associated with NIV failure. Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) has been proven to be very effective in patients receiving NIV. We aimed to assess the efficacy of MI-E as part of an extubation protocol.\n\nABSTRACT.METHOD: Patients with mechanical ventilation (MV) for more than 48 hours with specific inclusion criteria, who successfully tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), were randomly allocated before extubation, either for (A) a conventional extubation protocol (control group), or (B) the MI-E extubation protocol (study group). During the postextubation period (48 hours), group A patients received standard medical treatment (SMT), including NIV in case of specific indications, whereas group B received the same postextubation approach plus three daily sessions of mechanical in-exsufflation (MI-E). Reintubation rates, ICU length of stay, and NIV failure rates were analyzed.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Seventy-five patients (26 women) with a mean age of 61.8 ± 17.3 years were randomized to a control group (n = 40; mean SAPS II, 47.8 ± 17.7) and to a study group (n = 35; mean SAPS II, 45.0 ± 15.0). MV time before enrollment was 9.4 ± 4.8 and 10.5 ± 4.1 days for the control and the study group, respectively. In the 48 hours after extubation, 20 control patients (50%) and 14 study patients (40%) used NIV. Study group patients had a significant lower reintubation rate than did controls; six patients (17%) versus 19 patients (48%), P < 0.05; respectively, and a significantly lower time under MV; 17.8 ± 6.4 versus 11.7 ± 3.5 days; P < 0.05; respectively. Considering only the subgroup of patients that used NIV, the reintubation rates related to NIV failure were significantly lower in the study group when compared with controls; two patients (6%) versus 13 (33%); P < 0.05, respectively. Mean ICU length of stay after extubation was significantly lower in the study group when compared with controls (3.1 ± 2.5 versus 9.8 ± 6.7 days; P < 0.05). No differences were found in the total ICU length of stay.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Inclusion of MI-E may reduce reintubation rates with consequent reduction in postextubation ICU length of stay.

The efficacy and safety of oral bisphosphonates for the treatment of osteoporosis are well established. However, patient adherence and persistence on treatment are suboptimal. This randomised open-label multi-centre study of 6-months' duration compared persistence on treatment in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis receiving either once-monthly ibandronate plus a patient support programme (PSP), or once-weekly alendronate. To avoid falsely elevated persistence rates often associated with clinical trials, the study was designed to reflect everyday clinical practice in the UK and follow-up visits were limited to be consistent with the primary care setting. Analysis of the primary endpoint showed that persistence was significantly higher in the ibandronate/PSP group compared with the alendronate group (p < 0.0001). The estimated proportion of patients persisting with treatment at 6 months was 56.6% (306/541) and 38.6% (198/513) in the ibandronate/PSP and alendronate groups, respectively. Therefore, compared with alendronate, there was a 47% relative improvement in the proportion of patients persisting with treatment in the ibandronate/PSP group. Secondary endpoint measurements of adherence (e.g. proportion of patients remaining on treatment at study end; proportion of patients discontinuing from the study) were also significantly different in favour of ibandronate plus patient support. In summary, the PERSIST study demonstrated that persistence on treatment was increased in patients receiving once-monthly ibandronate plus patient support compared with once-weekly alendronate. Increased persistence on bisphosphonate treatment is expected to improve patient outcomes and decrease the social and economic burden of osteoporosis.\n\nFindings:\n[[\" ibandronate plus a patient support programme (PSP)\", \"alendronate\", \"persistence on treatment\", \"significantly increased\", \"Analysis of the primary endpoint showed that persistence was significantly higher in the ibandronate/PSP group compared with the alendronate group (p \\u003c 0.0001).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

We measured bone mass density (BMD) and bone turnover biomarkers (osteocalcin, osteocalcin, procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP), alkaline phosphatase, type I collagen cross-linked C-telopeptide (CTx), and osteoprotegerin). We assessed renal function by estimated creatinine clearance, plasma cystatin C, and urinary levels of creatinine, albumin, cystatin C, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL). The changes from baseline in BMD and renal and bone biomarkers were compared across study arms.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Of 40 included patients, 35 completed 48 weeks of randomized therapy and follow up. BMD was measured in 33, 26, and 27 patients at baseline, week 24, and week 48, respectively. In TDF/FTC-treated patients we observed significant reductions from baseline in hip and lumbar spine BMD at week 24 (−1.8% and −2.5%) and week 48 (−2.1% and −2.1%), whereas BMD was stable in patients in the ABC/3TC arm. The changes from baseline in BMD were significantly different between study arms. All bone turnover biomarkers except osteoprotegerin increased in the TDF/FTC arm compared with the ABC/3TC arm, but early changes did not predict subsequent loss of BMD. Renal function parameters were similar between study arms although a small increase in NGAL was detected among TDF-treated patients.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Switching to TDF/FTC-based therapy led to decreases in BMD and increases in bone turnover markers compared with ABC/3TC-based treatment.

However, the individual and combined effects of whey protein and carbohydrates on long-term resistance training adaptations are poorly understood.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: A four-week preparatory RT period was conducted in previously untrained males to standardize the training background of the subjects. Thereafter, the subjects were randomized into three groups: 30 g of whey proteins (n = 22), isocaloric carbohydrates (maltodextrin, n = 21), or protein + carbohydrates (n = 25). Within these groups, the subjects were further randomized into two whole-body 12-week RT regimens aiming either for muscle hypertrophy and maximal strength or muscle strength, hypertrophy and power. The post-exercise drink was always ingested immediately after the exercise bout, 2–3 times per week depending on the training period. Body composition (by DXA), quadriceps femoris muscle cross-sectional area (by panoramic ultrasound), maximal strength (by dynamic and isometric leg press) and serum lipids as basic markers of cardiovascular health, were analysed before and after the intervention.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Twelve-week RT led to increased fat-free mass, muscle size and strength independent of post-exercise nutrient intake (P < 0.05). However, the whey protein group reduced more total and abdominal area fat when compared to the carbohydrate group independent of the type of RT (P < 0.05). Thus, a larger relative increase (per kg bodyweight) in fat-free mass was observed in the protein vs. carbohydrate group (P < 0.05) without significant differences to the combined group. No systematic effects of the interventions were found for serum lipids. The RT type did not have an effect on the adaptations in response to different supplementation paradigms.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Post-exercise supplementation with whey proteins when compared to carbohydrates or combination of proteins and carbohydrates did not have a major effect on muscle size or strength when ingested two to three times a week. However, whey proteins may increase abdominal fat loss and relative fat-free mass adaptations in response to resistance training when compared to fast-acting carbohydrates.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"30\\u0026nbsp;g of whey proteins,\", \" isocaloric carbohydrates (maltodextrin)\", \"total and abdominal area fat\", \"significantly decreased\", \"However, the whey protein group reduced more total and abdominal area fat when compared to the carbohydrate group independent of the type of RT (P\\u2009\\u0026lt;\\u20090.05).\"], [\"30\\u0026nbsp;g of whey proteins,\", \" isocaloric carbohydrates (maltodextrin)\", \"total and abdominal area fat\", \"significantly decreased\", \"However, the whey protein group reduced more total and abdominal area fat when compared to the carbohydrate group independent of the type of RT (P\\u2009\\u003c\\u20090.05).\"], [\"30g of whey proteins,\", \" isocaloric carbohydrates (maltodextrin)\", \"fat-free mass\", \"significantly increased\", \"Thus, a larger relative increase (per kg bodyweight) in fat-free mass was observed in the protein vs. carbohydrate group (P\\u2009\\u0026lt;\\u20090.05) without significant differences to the combined group.\"], [\"30g of whey proteins,\", \" isocaloric carbohydrates (maltodextrin)\", \"fat-free mass\", \"significantly increased\", \"a larger relative increase (per kg bodyweight) in fat-free mass was observed in the protein vs. carbohydrate group (P\\u2009\\u003c\\u20090.05) without significant differences to the combined group.\"], [\"protein\\u2009+\\u2009carbohydrates\", \" isocaloric carbohydrates (maltodextrin)\", \"serum lipids\", \"no significant difference\", \"No systematic effects of the interventions were found for serum lipids.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Pharmacies in arm A provided the intervention for antidepressants and bisphosphonates and usual care for RAS-inhibitors and statins. Pharmacies in arm B provided the intervention for RAS-inhibitors and statins and usual care for antidepressants and bisphosphonates. <p> Intervention: Intervention consisted of a telephone counseling intervention 7–21 days after the start of therapy. Counseling included assessment of practical and perceptual barriers and provision of information and motivation. <p> Main outcome measure: Primary outcome was refill adherence measured over 1 year expressed as continuous outcome and dichotomous (refill rate≥80%). Secondary outcome was discontinuation within 1 year. <p> Results: In the control arms 3627 patients were eligible and in the intervention arms 3094 patients. Of the latter, 1054 patients (34%) received the intervention. Intention to treat analysis showed no difference in adherence rates between the intervention and the usual care arm (74.7%, SD 37.5 respectively 74.5%, 37.9). More patients starting with RAS-inhibitors had a refill ratio ≥80% in the intervention arm compared to usual care (81.4 vs. 74.9% with odds ratio (OR) 1.43, 95%CI 1.11–1.99). Comparing patients with counseling to patients with usual care (per protocol analysis), adherence was statistically significant higher for patients starting with RAS-inhibitors, statins and bisphosphonates. Patients initiating antidepressants did not benefit from the intervention. <p> Conclusions: Telephone counseling at start of therapy improved adherence in patients initiating RAS-inhibitors.

Given that immigrant parents and children are at greater risk for becoming overweight/obese with increased time in the US, identification of risk factors for weight gain is critical.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Baseline data was collected on 383 mother-child dyads enrolled in Live Well, a community-based, participatory, randomized controlled lifestyle intervention to prevent weight gain in recent immigrant mothers. Socio-demographic information together with heights and weights were collected for both mother and child. Acculturation, behavioral data, and responses to the Caregiver's Feeding Styles Questionnaire (CFSQ) were also obtained from the mother.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The children's average age was 6.2 ± 2.7 years, 58% male. Mothers had been in the country for an average of 6.0 ± 3.3 years, and are Brazilian (36%), Haitian (34%) and Latino (30%). Seventy-two percent of the mothers were overweight/obese, while 43% of the children were overweight/obese. Fifteen percent of mothers reported their feeding style as being high demanding/high responsive; 32% as being high demanding/low responsive; 34% as being low demanding/high responsive and 18% as being low demanding/low responsive. In bivariate analyses, feeding styles significantly differed by child BMIz-score, ethnic group, and mother's perceived stress. In multiple linear regression, a low demanding/high responsive feeding style was found to be positively associated (ß = 0.56) with a higher child weight as compared to high demanding/high responsive, controlling for known covariates (p = 0.01).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Most mothers report having a low demanding/high responsive feeding style, which is associated with higher child weight status in this diverse immigrant population. This finding adds to the growing literature that suggests this type of feeding style may be a risk factor for childhood obesity. Further research is needed to help understand the larger socio-cultural context and its influence on feeding dynamics among immigrant families and families of lower incomes. How parents establish a certain feeding style in their home country compared to when they move to the US \"obesogenic\" environment, should also be explored.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"low demanding/high responsive feeding style\", \"high demanding/high responsive feeding style\", \"child weight\", \"significantly increased\", \"In multiple linear regression, a low demanding/high responsive feeding style was found to be positively associated (\\u00df = 0.56) with a higher child weight as compared to high demanding/high responsive, controlling for known covariates (p = 0.01).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Pharmacies in arm A provided the intervention for antidepressants and bisphosphonates and usual care for RAS-inhibitors and statins. Pharmacies in arm B provided the intervention for RAS-inhibitors and statins and usual care for antidepressants and bisphosphonates. <p> Intervention: Intervention consisted of a telephone counseling intervention 7–21 days after the start of therapy. Counseling included assessment of practical and perceptual barriers and provision of information and motivation. <p> Main outcome measure: Primary outcome was refill adherence measured over 1 year expressed as continuous outcome and dichotomous (refill rate≥80%). Secondary outcome was discontinuation within 1 year. <p> Results: In the control arms 3627 patients were eligible and in the intervention arms 3094 patients. Of the latter, 1054 patients (34%) received the intervention. Intention to treat analysis showed no difference in adherence rates between the intervention and the usual care arm (74.7%, SD 37.5 respectively 74.5%, 37.9). More patients starting with RAS-inhibitors had a refill ratio ≥80% in the intervention arm compared to usual care (81.4 vs. 74.9% with odds ratio (OR) 1.43, 95%CI 1.11–1.99). Comparing patients with counseling to patients with usual care (per protocol analysis), adherence was statistically significant higher for patients starting with RAS-inhibitors, statins and bisphosphonates. Patients initiating antidepressants did not benefit from the intervention. <p> Conclusions: Telephone counseling at start of therapy improved adherence in patients initiating RAS-inhibitors. The per protocol analysis indicated an improvement for lipid lowering drugs and bisphosphonates. No effect for on adherence in patients initiating antidepressants was found. <p> The trial was registered at www.trialregister.nl under the identifier NTR3237.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"telephone counseling intervention\", \"usual care\", \"refill adherence\", \"significantly increased\", \"More patients starting with RAS-inhibitors had a refill ratio ≥80% in the intervention arm compared to usual care (81.4 vs. 74.9% with odds ratio (OR) 1.43, 95%CI 1.11–1.99).\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"telephone counseling intervention\", \"usual care\", \"refill adherence\", \"significantly increased\", \"More patients starting with RAS-inhibitors had a refill ratio ≥80% in the intervention arm compared to usual care (81.4 vs. 74.9% with odds ratio (OR) 1.43, 95%CI 1.11–1.99).\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "9083d9b716fffad80cdb91a9a0e2a98fa0d995918d38b6b70b253a06f3a1fa3d", "prompt_hash": "ae817ea6eb7d7f406307d4a41c1cdebc781b360a5ff8ec3d461eb9a2f03854f1", "target_hash": "82b7e7a714367bb6c86e4a947ada0b16a719dee57891e8c1a9530c37bdb46301", "bypass": null}

This study was designed to compare the effects of palonosetron and ondansetron in preventing PONV in high-risk patients receiving intravenous opioid-based patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA) after gynecological laparoscopic surgery.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: One hundred non-smoking female patients scheduled for gynecological laparoscopic surgery were randomly assigned into the palonosetron group (n = 50) or the ondansetron group (n = 50). Palonosetron 0.075 mg was injected as a bolus in the palonosetron group. Ondansetron 8 mg was injected as a bolus and 16 mg was added to the IV-PCA in the ondansetron group. The incidences of nausea, vomiting and side effects was recorded at 2 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h, postoperatively.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the groups in the incidence of PONV during 72 h after operation.

This 12-week, double-blind study compared the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of indacaterol to that of placebo in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Efficacy variables included 24-h trough FEV1 (mean of 23 h 10 min and 23 h 45 min post-dose) at Week 12 (primary endpoint) and after Day 1, and the percentage of COPD days with poor control (i.e., worsening symptoms). Safety was assessed by adverse events (AEs), mean serum potassium and blood glucose, QTc (Fridericia), and vital signs.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Patients were randomised (n = 416, mean age 63 years) to receive either indacaterol 150 μg o.d. (n = 211) or placebo (n = 205) via a single-dose dry-powder inhaler; 87.5% completed the study. Trough FEV1 (LSM ± SEM) at Week 12 was 1.48 ± 0.018 L for indacaterol and 1.35 ± 0.019 L for placebo, a clinically relevant difference of 130 ± 24 mL (p < 0.001). Trough FEV1 after one dose was significantly higher with indacaterol than placebo (p < 0.001). Indacaterol demonstrated significantly higher peak FEV1 than placebo, both on Day 1 and at Week 12, with indacaterol-placebo differences (LSM ± SEM) of 190 ± 28 (p < 0.001) and 160 ± 28 mL (p < 0.001), respectively. Standardised AUC measurements for FEV1 (between 5 min and 4 h, 5 min and 1 h, and 1 and 4 h post-dose) at Week 12 were all significantly greater with indacaterol than placebo (p < 0.001), with LSM (± SEM) differences of 170 ± 24, 180 ± 24, and 170 ± 24 mL, respectively. Indacaterol significantly reduced the percentage of days of poor control versus placebo by 22.5% (p < 0.001) and was also associated with significantly reduced use of rescue medication (p < 0.001). The overall rates of AEs were comparable between the groups (indacaterol 49.3%, placebo 46.8%), with the most common AEs being COPD worsening (indacaterol 8.5%, placebo 12.2%) and cough (indacaterol 6.2%, placebo 7.3%). One patient died in the placebo group. Serum potassium and blood glucose levels did not differ significantly between the two groups, and no patient had QTc >500 ms.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Indacaterol 150 μg o.d. provided clinically significant and sustained bronchodilation, reduced rescue medication use, and had a safety and tolerability profile similar to placebo.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT00624286\n\nFindings:\n[[\"indacaterol 150 \\u03bcg o.d\", \"placebo\", \"FEV1 after one dose\", \"significantly increased\", \"Trough FEV1 after one dose was significantly higher with indacaterol than placebo (p \\u003c 0.001).\"], [\"indacaterol 150 \\u03bcg o.d\", \"placebo\", \"Standardised AUC measurements for FEV1 at Week 12\", \"significantly increased\", \"Standardised AUC measurements for FEV1 (between 5 min and 4 h, 5 min and 1 h, and 1 and 4 h post-dose) at Week 12 were all significantly greater with indacaterol than placebo (p \\u003c 0.001), with LSM (\\u00b1 SEM) differences of 170 \\u00b1 24, 180 \\u00b1 24, and 170 \\u00b1 24 mL, respectively.\"], [\"indacaterol 150 \\u03bcg o.d\", \"placebo\", \"forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) at Week 12\", \"significantly increased\", \"Trough FEV1 (LSM \\u00b1 SEM) at Week 12 was 1.48 \\u00b1 0.018 L for indacaterol and 1.35 \\u00b1 0.019 L for placebo, a clinically relevant difference of 130 \\u00b1 24 mL (p \\u003c 0.001).\"], [\"indacaterol 150 \\u03bcg o.d\", \"placebo\", \"The overall rate of adverse events (ASs)\", \"no significant difference\", \"The overall rates of AEs were comparable between the groups (indacaterol 49.3%, placebo 46.8%)\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

This study aimed to design and implement an empowerment educational intervention to prevent elder abuse.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: This parallel randomized controlled trial was conducted in 2014–2016 for 18 months on 464 older adults aged above 60 years who visited health houses of 22 municipalities in Tehran. Data were collected using standard questionnaires, including the Elder Abuse-Knowledge Questionnaire, Health-Promoting Behavior Questionnaire, Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II, Barriers to Healthy Lifestyle, Perceived Social Support, Perceived Self-Efficacy, Loneliness Scale, Geriatric Depression Scale, Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale, and the SCARED (stress, coping, argument, resources, events, and dependence) tool. The intervention was done in twenty 45- to 60-minute training sessions over 6 months. Data analysis were performed using χ2 tests, multiple linear and logistic regression, and structural equation modeling (SEM).\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The frequency of knowledge of elder abuse, self-efficacy, social support and health promoting lifestyle before the intervention was similar in the two groups.

Furthermore, it has found application in combination with other drugs in the dermatological field and in pre-clinical studies in animal models of osteoarthritis. Experimental evidence suggests that a combination of this macromolecule with other drugs may act as a slow-release depot. However, to date, to the best of our knowledge, no one has tested local intra-articular delivery of highly cross-linked hyaluronic acid combined with bisphosphonate or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for management of knee osteoarthritis pain in the clinical setting. The aim of the present randomized double-blind study was to investigate, for the first time, the effect of a highly cross-linked hyaluronic acid, Variofill®, alone or in combination with diclofenac sodium or sodium clodronate, for management of bilateral knee osteoarthritis-related pain.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Sixty-two patients with symptomatic bilateral medial tibiofemoral knee osteoarthritis (Kellgren–Lawrence grade II and III) and pain in both knees corresponding to a daily visual analog scale (VAS) score ≥ 30 in the month before the beginning of the study were included in this investigation. Patients were divided into three groups: group 1, treated with an injection of hyaluronic acid alone (66 mg) into each knee; group 2, treated with an injection of hyaluronic acid (49.5 mg) plus diclofenac sodium (5 mg) into each knee; group 3, treated with an injection of hyaluronic acid (49.5 mg) plus sodium clodronate (5 mg) into each knee. Patients also underwent blood tests for measurement of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) immediately before and at 6-month follow-up.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Hyaluronic acid alone and in combination with sodium clodronate or diclofenac sodium produced a significant improvement in mean VAS pain score at 3 and 6-month follow-up. At 6-month follow-up, therapy with hyaluronic acid plus sodium clodronate was the most beneficial in terms of percentage improvement in VAS pain score. A significant improvement in ESR and CRP was observed at 6-month follow-up in each treatment group. No significant difference was observed when the percentage change from baseline related to these parameters was compared among the groups. No dropout was observed in any group. No serious adverse events were observed.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Further studies are necessary to determine the effect of a therapy based on hyaluronic acid combined with diclofenac sodium or sodium clodronate in larger cohorts of patients affected by knee osteoarthritis and in longer-term follow-up.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"group 1, treated with an injection of hyaluronic acid alone (66 mg) into each knee; group 2, treated with an injection of hyaluronic acid (49.5 mg) plus diclofenac sodium (5 mg) into each knee;\", \"group 3, treated with an injection of hyaluronic acid (49.5 mg) plus sodium clodronate (5 mg) into each knee\", \"erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)\", \"no significant difference\", \"A significant improvement in ESR and CRP was observed at 6-month follow-up in each treatment group.

This study aimed to design and implement an empowerment educational intervention to prevent elder abuse.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: This parallel randomized controlled trial was conducted in 2014–2016 for 18 months on 464 older adults aged above 60 years who visited health houses of 22 municipalities in Tehran. Data were collected using standard questionnaires, including the Elder Abuse-Knowledge Questionnaire, Health-Promoting Behavior Questionnaire, Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II, Barriers to Healthy Lifestyle, Perceived Social Support, Perceived Self-Efficacy, Loneliness Scale, Geriatric Depression Scale, Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale, and the SCARED (stress, coping, argument, resources, events, and dependence) tool. The intervention was done in twenty 45- to 60-minute training sessions over 6 months. Data analysis were performed using χ2 tests, multiple linear and logistic regression, and structural equation modeling (SEM).\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The frequency of knowledge of elder abuse, self-efficacy, social support and health promoting lifestyle before the intervention was similar in the two groups. However, the frequency of high knowledge of elder abuse (94.8% in the intervention group and 46.6% in the control group), high self-efficacy (82.8% and 7.8%, respectively), high social support (97.0% and 10.3%, respectively) and high health promoting lifestyle (97.0% and 10.3%, respectively) was significantly higher (P<0.001) and the frequency of elder abuse risk (28.0% and 49.6%, respectively) was significantly less in the intervention group after the intervention.

Actual exposure to CT interventions is not living up to its high expectations, as only a (limited) proportion of the target group is actually using these programs.\n\nABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE: To investigate exposure to an Internet-delivered, CT lifestyle intervention, targeting physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, smoking behavior, and alcohol intake, we focused on three processes: first use, prolonged use, and sustained use. The first objectives were to identify user characteristics that predict initiation of an online CT lifestyle program (first use) and completion of this program (prolonged use). Furthermore, we studied the effect of using a proactive strategy, consisting of periodic email prompts, on program revisits (sustained use).\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: The research population for this study consisted of Dutch adults participating in the Adult Health Monitor, offered by the regional public health services. We used a randomized controlled trial design to assess predictors of first use, prolonged use, and sustained use. Demographics and behavioral characteristics, as well as the strategy used for revisiting, were included as predictors in the model.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: A total of 9169 participants indicated their interest in the new program and 5168 actually logged in to the program. Participants significantly more likely to initiate one of the CT modules were male, older, and employed, and had a lower income, higher body mass index, and relatively unhealthy lifestyle. Participants significantly more likely to complete one of the CT modules were older and had a higher income and a relatively healthier lifestyle. Finally, using a proactive strategy influenced sustained use, with people from the prompting condition being more likely to revisit the program (odds ratio 28.92, 95% confidence interval 10.65–78.52; P < .001).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Older, male, and employed participants, and those with a lower income, higher body mass index, and a relatively unhealthy lifestyle were more likely to initiate a CT module. Module completers predominantly had a higher income and age. The current program therefore succeeded in reaching those people who benefit most from online lifestyle interventions. However, these people tended to disengage from the program. This underlines the importance of additional research into program adjustments and strategies that can be used to stimulate prolonged program use. Furthermore, sending periodic email prompts significantly increased revisits to the program. Though promising, this effect was modest and needs to be further examined, in order to maximize the potential of periodic email prompting.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Nederlands Trial Register (NTR: 1786) and Medical Ethics Committee of Maastricht University and the University Hospital Maastricht (NL2723506809/MEC0903016); http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=1786 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/65hBXA6V7)\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"Periodic Email Prompt\", \"Control\", \"Revisiting the program\", \"significantly increased\", \"Finally, using a proactive strategy influenced sustained use, with people from the prompting condition being more likely to revisit the program (odds ratio 28.92, 95% confidence interval 10.65\\u201378.52; P \\u003c .001).\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:172"}, "target": "[[\"Periodic Email Prompt\", \"Control\", \"Revisiting the program\", \"significantly increased\", \"Finally, using a proactive strategy influenced sustained use, with people from the prompting condition being more likely to revisit the program (odds ratio 28.92, 95% confidence interval 10.65\\u201378.52; P \\u003c .001).\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) secreted by the embryo is known to play a key role in this process and to trigger a complex signal transduction cascade allowing the apposition, attachment, and invasion of the embryo into the decidualized uterus. Production of hCG was reported to be dependent on blastocyst quality and several articles suggested that intrauterine hCG injection increases pregnancy and implantation rates in IVF patients. However, no study has as yet analysed birth rates as final outcome. Our objective was to determine whether clinical outcome after blastocyst transfer can be improved by intrauterine injection of hCG and whether this is dependent on blastocyst quality.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: A prospective randomised study was conducted in two settings. In cohort A, hCG application was performed two days before blastocyst transfer. In cohort B, the administration of hCG occurred just prior to embryo transfer on day 5. For both cohorts, patients were randomised to either intrauterine hCG application or to the control group that received culture medium. Clinical outcome was analysed according to blastocyst quality of transferred embryos.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The outcome of 182 IVF-cycles (cohort A) and 1004 IVF-cycles (cohort B) was analysed. All patients received a fresh autologous blastocyst transfer on day five. Primary outcomes were pregnancy rates (PR), clinical pregnancy rates (cPR), miscarriage rates (MR), and live birth rates (LBR). No improvement of clinical outcome after intrauterine hCG administration on day 3 (cohort A) or day 5 (cohort B) was found, independently of blastocyst quality transferred. The final outcome in cohort A: LBR after transfer of top blastocysts was 50.0 % with hCG and 53.3 % in the control group. With non-top blastocysts, LBR of 17.1 % (hCG) and 18.2 % (control) were observed (n.s.). In cohort B, LBR with top blastocysts was 53.3 % (hCG) and 48.4 % (control), with non-top blastocysts it came to 28.7 % (hCG) and 35.0 % (control). The differences between the groups were statistically not significant. Furthermore, we investigated a possible benefit of hCG administration in correlation with female age. In both age groups (<38 years and ≥ 38 years) we found similar LBR after treatment with hCG vs. medium. A LBR of 47.1 % vs. 48.7 % was obtained in the younger group and 26.6 % vs. 30.8 % in the older group.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to previous studies indicating a substantial benefit from intrauterine hCG application in cleavage stage embryo transfers, in our study we could not find any evidence for improvement of clinical outcome in blastocyst transfer cycles, neither with top nor with non-top quality morphology.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"cohort B, the administration of hCG occurred just prior to embryo transfer on day 5 with top blastocysts and with non-top blastocysts \", \"control\", \"live birth rates (LBR)\", \"no significant difference\", \"In cohort B, LBR with top blastocysts was 53.3 % (hCG) and 48.4 % (control), with non-top blastocysts it came to 28.7 % (hCG) and 35.0 % (control).

Demographics and behavioral characteristics, as well as the strategy used for revisiting, were included as predictors in the model.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: A total of 9169 participants indicated their interest in the new program and 5168 actually logged in to the program. Participants significantly more likely to initiate one of the CT modules were male, older, and employed, and had a lower income, higher body mass index, and relatively unhealthy lifestyle. Participants significantly more likely to complete one of the CT modules were older and had a higher income and a relatively healthier lifestyle. Finally, using a proactive strategy influenced sustained use, with people from the prompting condition being more likely to revisit the program (odds ratio 28.92, 95% confidence interval 10.65–78.52; P < .001).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Older, male, and employed participants, and those with a lower income, higher body mass index, and a relatively unhealthy lifestyle were more likely to initiate a CT module. Module completers predominantly had a higher income and age. The current program therefore succeeded in reaching those people who benefit most from online lifestyle interventions. However, these people tended to disengage from the program. This underlines the importance of additional research into program adjustments and strategies that can be used to stimulate prolonged program use. Furthermore, sending periodic email prompts significantly increased revisits to the program. Though promising, this effect was modest and needs to be further examined, in order to maximize the potential of periodic email prompting.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Nederlands Trial Register (NTR: 1786) and Medical Ethics Committee of Maastricht University and the University Hospital Maastricht (NL2723506809/MEC0903016); http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=1786 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/65hBXA6V7)\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[[\"using a proactive strategy, consisting of periodic email prompts\", \"null\", \"program revisits\", \"significantly increased\", \"using a proactive strategy influenced sustained use, with people from the prompting condition being more likely to revisit the program (odds ratio 28.92, 95% confidence interval 10.65–78.52; P < .001).\"]]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[[\"using a proactive strategy, consisting of periodic email prompts\", \"null\", \"program revisits\", \"significantly increased\", \"using a proactive strategy influenced sustained use, with people from the prompting condition being more likely to revisit the program (odds ratio 28.92, 95% confidence interval 10.65–78.52; P < .001).\"]]"], "doc_hash": "4977deac3661818992a2404fd1c80c3769c51a9406b6717e1eeca9054cbbf015", "prompt_hash": "9ca42730fbeb3ad21f151cf64bcdca2ef3451c9643ce7b1b9def08b2f123a3cb", "target_hash": "419efeb89a96f682c97e6feef5b1861f9e353d69693cee44f7ea70298af4f4db", "bypass": null}

Their effectiveness is reported to be similar, and therefore the costs of treatment represent a major issue to be considered. Although several studies about costs in IVF have been published, data obtained in low-technology infertility treatments are still scarce.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Two hundred and sixty infertile women (184 with unexplained infertility, 76 with CC-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome) at their first treatment cycle were randomized and included in the study. Ovulation induction was accomplished by daily administration of rFSH or HP-uFSH according to a low-dose, step-up regimen aimed to obtain a monofollicular ovulation. A bi- or tri-follicular ovulation was anyway accepted, whereas hCG was withdrawn and the cycle cancelled when more than three follicles greater than or equal to 18 mm diameter were seen at ultrasound. The primary outcome measure was the cost of therapy per delivered baby, estimated according to a cost-minimization analysis. Secondary outcomes were the following: monofollicular ovulation rate, total FSH dose, cycle cancellation rate, length of the follicular phase, number of developing follicles (>12 mm diameter), endometrial thickness at hCG, incidence of twinning and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, delivery rate.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The overall FSH dose needed to achieve ovulation was significantly lower with r-FSH, whereas all the other studied variables did not significantly differ with either treatments. However, a trend toward a higher delivery rate with r-FSH was observed in the whole group and also when results were considered subgrouping patients according to the indication to treatment.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Considering the significantly lower number of vials/patient and the slight (although non-significant) increase in the delivery rate with r-FSH, the cost-minimization analysis showed a 9.4% reduction in the overall therapy cost per born baby in favor of r-FSH.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"recombinant FSH (r-FSH)\", \"highly-purified, urinary FSH (HP-uFSH)\", \"total FSH dose\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The overall FSH dose needed to achieve ovulation was significantly lower with r-FSH,\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Diabetes self-management education (DSME) is key to enabling patients to manage their chronic condition and can reduce the occurrence of costly and devastating complications. However, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of different DSME programmes in resource limited settings.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: We conducted an unblinded, parallel-group, individually-randomised controlled trial at the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital (Nigeria) to evaluate whether an intensive and systematic DSME programme, using structured guidelines, improved glycaemic control compared to the existing ad hoc patient education (clinical practice was unchanged). Eligible patients (≥18 years, HbA1c > 8.5% and physically able to participate) were randomly allocated by permuted block randomisation to participate for six months in either an intensive or conventional education group. The primary outcome was HbA1c (%) at six-months.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: We randomised 59 participants to each group and obtained six-month HbA1c outcomes from 53 and 51 participants in the intensive and conventional education groups, respectively. Intensive group participants had a mean six-month HbA1c (%) of 8.4 (95% CI: 8 to 8.9), while participants in the conventional education group had a mean six-month HbA1c (%) of 10.2 (95% CI: 9.8 to 10.7). The difference was statistically (P < 0.0001) and clinically significant, with intensive group participants having HbA1c outcomes on average -1.8 (95% CI: -2.4 to -1.2) percentage points lower than conventional group participants.

The study had a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, cross-over design, with each of the two treatment periods lasting no more than 3 months. At the end of the study, patients were asked to assign preference to one of the treatments (primary endpoint). The number of pain-free (PF) and pain-relief (PR) episodes at 2 h, and number of recurrent and sustained pain-free (SPF) episodes within 48 h were the secondary study endpoints. Seventy-seven percent of patients expressed a preference. Average score of preference was 2.9 ± 1.3 (F) versus 3.0 ± 1.3 (Z; p = NS). Rate of PF episodes at 2 h was 26% with F and 31% with Z (p = NS). PR episodes at 2 h were 57% for F and 58% for Z (p = NS). Rate of recurrence was 21 (F) and 24% (Z; p = NS). Time to recurrence within 48 h was better for F especially between 4 and 16 h (p < 0.05). SPF episodes were 18 (F) versus 22% (Z; p = NS). Drug-related adverse events were significantly (p < 0.05) less under F (3 vs. 10).

This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study assessed the effects of RMD in the colonic transit time (CTT) and defecation characteristics (frequency, stool volume and consistency).\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Sixty-six healthy adult volunteers (32 men) who did not have a daily defecation habit had a 7-day run-in period before the 21-day intervention period with RMD or placebo. CTT and segmental CTT (SCTT) were assessed by a single abdominal X-ray film taken at the end of both periods after radiopaque marker ingestion. Defecation characteristics and intestinal functions were also assessed, which were self-reported by patients. Intragroup comparisons were evaluated by Student's paired t test, Bonferroni test and Chi-square test, while time comparisons by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and time-by-treatment interaction by repeated-measures ANOVA.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Fifty-seven subjects were assessed for CTT (placebo, n = 28; RMD, n = 29). In the RMD group, the total CTT, left SCTT and rectosigmoidal SCTT decreased significantly compared to baseline (p < 0.01 each; −13.3, −4.7, −8.7 h, respectively). Significant differences between groups were observed in total CTT and left SCTT. Significant time-by-treatment interaction was observed in the RMD group for stool volume (p = 0.014), increasing 56 % compared to baseline (p < 0.01), while remained unchanged in the placebo group. Stool consistency was improved only in the RMD group (p < 0.01). No adverse effects related to study products were observed.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: The results show that RMD improved CTT, stool volume, stool consistency and some intestinal functions in a healthy population.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Digestion-resistant maltodextrin\", \"Placebo\", \"Adverse events\", \"no significant difference\", \"No adverse effects related to study products were observed.\"], [\"Digestion-resistant maltodextrin\", \"Placebo\", \"Improvement in faeces consistency \", \"significantly increased\", \"Stool consistency was improved only in the RMD group (p \\u003c 0.01)\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Objectives: As N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction has been shown to contribute to these cognitive impairments, the primary aims of this healthy volunteer study were to: (a) to shed light on the separate and interactive roles of nAChR and NMDAR systems in the modulation of auditory sensory memory (and sustained attention), as indexed by the auditory event-related brain potential – mismatch negativity (MMN), and (b) to examine how these effects are moderated by a predisposition to auditory hallucinations/delusions (HD). Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design involving a low intravenous dose of ketamine (0.04 mg/kg) and a 4 mg dose of nicotine gum, MMN, and performance on a rapid visual information processing (RVIP) task of sustained attention were examined in 24 healthy controls psychometrically stratified as being lower (L-HD, n = 12) or higher (H-HD) for HD propensity. Results: Ketamine significantly slowed MMN, and reduced MMN in H-HD, with amplitude attenuation being blocked by the co-administration of nicotine. Nicotine significantly enhanced response speed [reaction time (RT)] and accuracy (increased % hits and d′ and reduced false alarms) on the RVIP, with improved performance accuracy being prevented when nicotine was administered with ketamine. Both % hits and d′, as well as RT were poorer in H-HD (vs. L-HD) and while hit rate and d′ was increased by nicotine in H-HD, RT was slowed by ketamine in L-HD. Conclusions: Nicotine alleviated ketamine-induced sensory memory impairment and improved attention, particularly in individuals prone to HD.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"(KI) low intravenous dose of ketamine (0.04 mg/kg)\", \"(NG) 4 mg dose of nicotine gum\", \"hit rate in high - hallucinations/delusions (H-HD)\", \"significantly decreased\", \"hit rate and d\\u2032 was increased by nicotine in H-HD\"], [\"(KI) low intravenous dose of ketamine (0.04 mg/kg)\", \"(NG) 4 mg dose of nicotine gum\", \"hit rate in high - hallucinations/delusions (H-HD)\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Ketamine significantly slowed MMN, and reduced MMN in H-HD, with amplitude attenuation being blocked by the co-administration of nicotine.\"], [\"(KI) low intravenous dose of ketamine (0.04 mg/kg)\", \"(NG) 4 mg dose of nicotine gum\", \"auditory event-related brain potential \\u2013 mismatch negativity (MMN) in high - hallucinations/delusions (H-HD)\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Ketamine significantly slowed MMN, and reduced MMN in H-HD\"], [\"(KI) low intravenous dose of ketamine (0.04 mg/kg)\", \"(NG) 4 mg dose of nicotine gum\", \"d\\u2032 (weight hits and false alarms into a single measure) in high - hallucinations/delusions (H-HD)\", \"significantly decreased\", \"hit rate and d\\u2032 was increased by nicotine in H-HD\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:176"}, "target": "[[\"(KI) low intravenous dose of ketamine (0.04 mg/kg)\", \"(NG) 4 mg dose of nicotine gum\", \"hit rate in high - hallucinations/delusions (H-HD)\", \"significantly decreased\", \"hit rate and d\\u2032 was increased by nicotine in H-HD\"], [\"(KI) low intravenous dose of ketamine (0.04 mg/kg)\", \"(NG) 4 mg dose of nicotine gum\", \"hit rate in high - hallucinations/delusions (H-HD)\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Ketamine significantly slowed MMN, and reduced MMN in H-HD, with amplitude attenuation being blocked by the co-administration of nicotine.\"], [\"(KI) low intravenous dose of ketamine (0.04 mg/kg)\", \"(NG) 4 mg dose of nicotine gum\", \"auditory event-related brain potential \\u2013 mismatch negativity (MMN) in high - hallucinations/delusions (H-HD)\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Ketamine significantly slowed MMN, and reduced MMN in H-HD\"], [\"(KI) low intravenous dose of ketamine (0.04 mg/kg)\", \"(NG) 4 mg dose of nicotine gum\", \"d\\u2032 (weight hits and false alarms into a single measure) in high - hallucinations/delusions (H-HD)\", \"significantly decreased\", \"hit rate and d\\u2032 was increased by nicotine in H-HD\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

As a consequence, this might lead to a higher intake of energy-dense snacks and less fruit and vegetables, a habit that increases the risk of developing chronic diseases. The aim of this experimental study is to examine whether playing a memory game with fruit affects fruit intake among young children. We used a randomized between-subject design with 127 children (age: 7–12 y) who played a memory-game, containing either fruit (n = 64) or non-food products (n = 63). While playing the memory-game in a separate room in school during school hours, free intake of fruit (mandarins, apples, bananas, and grapes) was measured. Afterwards, the children completed self-report measures, and length and weight were assessed. The main finding is that playing a memory-game containing fruit increases overall fruit intake (P = 0.016). Children who played the fruit version of the memory-game ate more bananas (P = 0.015) and mandarins (P = 0.036) than children who played the non-food memory-game; no effects were found for apples (P > 0.05) and grapes (P > 0.05). The findings suggest that playing a memory-game with fruit stimulates fruit intake among young children. This is an important finding because children eat insufficient fruit, according to international standards, and more traditional health interventions have limited success. Healthy eating habits of children maintain when they become adults, making it important to stimulate fruit intake among children in an enjoyable way. <p> Trial registration: Nederlands Trial Register TC = 5687\n\nFindings:\n[[\"memory game with fruit\", \"no fruit game\", \"higher banana intake\", \"significantly increased\", \"Children who played the fruit version of the memory-game ate more bananas (P = 0.015) and mandarins (P = 0.036) than children who played the non-food memory-game;\"], [\"memory game with fruit\", \"no fruit game\", \"higher apple intake\", \"no significant difference\", \"no effects were found for apples (P \\u003e 0.05) and grapes (P \\u003e 0.05)\"], [\"memory game with fruit\", \"no fruit game\", \"overall fruit intake\", \"significantly increased\", \"The main finding is that playing a memory-game containing fruit increases overall fruit intake (P = 0.016).\"], [\"memory game with fruit\", \"no fruit game\", \"higher grape intake\", \"no significant difference\", \"Children who played the fruit version of the memory-game ate more bananas (P = 0.015) and mandarins (P = 0.036) than children who played the non-food memory-game; no effects were found for apples (P \\u003e 0.05) and grapes (P \\u003e 0.05)\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Objectives: As N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction has been shown to contribute to these cognitive impairments, the primary aims of this healthy volunteer study were to: (a) to shed light on the separate and interactive roles of nAChR and NMDAR systems in the modulation of auditory sensory memory (and sustained attention), as indexed by the auditory event-related brain potential – mismatch negativity (MMN), and (b) to examine how these effects are moderated by a predisposition to auditory hallucinations/delusions (HD). Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design involving a low intravenous dose of ketamine (0.04 mg/kg) and a 4 mg dose of nicotine gum, MMN, and performance on a rapid visual information processing (RVIP) task of sustained attention were examined in 24 healthy controls psychometrically stratified as being lower (L-HD, n = 12) or higher (H-HD) for HD propensity. Results: Ketamine significantly slowed MMN, and reduced MMN in H-HD, with amplitude attenuation being blocked by the co-administration of nicotine. Nicotine significantly enhanced response speed [reaction time (RT)] and accuracy (increased % hits and d′ and reduced false alarms) on the RVIP, with improved performance accuracy being prevented when nicotine was administered with ketamine. Both % hits and d′, as well as RT were poorer in H-HD (vs. L-HD) and while hit rate and d′ was increased by nicotine in H-HD, RT was slowed by ketamine in L-HD. Conclusions: Nicotine alleviated ketamine-induced sensory memory impairment and improved attention, particularly in individuals prone to HD.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"nicotine gum\", \"placebo\", \"MMN amplitude\", \"significantly increased\", \"amplitude attenuation being blocked by the co-administration of nicotine.\"],\n    [\"nicotine gum\", \"placebo\", \"response speed (reaction time)\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Nicotine significantly enhanced response speed [reaction time (RT)] and accuracy (increased % hits and d′ and reduced false alarms) on the RVIP,\"],\n    [\"nicotine gum\", \"ketamine\", \"response speed (reaction time)\", \"significantly increased\", \"Nicotine significantly enhanced response speed [reaction time (RT)] and accuracy (increased % hits and d′ and reduced false alarms) on the RVIP, with improved performance accuracy being prevented when nicotine was administered with ketamine.\"],\n    [\"nicotine gum\", \"ketamine\", \"hit rate and d′\", \"significantly increased\", \"hit rate and d′ was increased by nicotine in H-HD, RT was slowed by ketamine in L-HD.\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"nicotine gum\", \"placebo\", \"MMN amplitude\", \"significantly increased\", \"amplitude attenuation being blocked by the co-administration of nicotine.\"],\n    [\"nicotine gum\", \"placebo\", \"response speed (reaction time)\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Nicotine significantly enhanced response speed [reaction time (RT)] and accuracy (increased % hits and d′ and reduced false alarms) on the RVIP,\"],\n    [\"nicotine gum\", \"ketamine\", \"response speed (reaction time)\", \"significantly increased\", \"Nicotine significantly enhanced response speed [reaction time (RT)] and accuracy (increased % hits and d′ and reduced false alarms) on the RVIP, with improved performance accuracy being prevented when nicotine was administered with ketamine.\"],\n    [\"nicotine gum\", \"ketamine\", \"hit rate and d′\", \"significantly increased\", \"hit rate and d′ was increased by nicotine in H-HD, RT was slowed by ketamine in L-HD.\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "8dcc57487cb45a6c6306b7ef1e1eadd045db7d4546246cb6f7015ae805e3bea8", "prompt_hash": "d2edf6d2205072a95ba5ec9118d87c80f68fddb4a812eaa0f1e10f8f890b634e", "target_hash": "9e94cc973f0a58da50ba945a0c0cc5a7b96d8dcbe7e7abb0ff5f90ea3191ab62", "bypass": null}

Among 189 adults [73 males, 116 females; age  = 41 to 74 years; mean body mass index (BMI)  = 27.3 kg/m2], assessments of %BF at the baseline and six months from the baseline were conducted by performing BIA and DXA. Bland-Altman analyses and multiple regression analyses were used to assess the relationships between %BFBIA and %BFDXA. Compared with DXA, BIA underestimated %BF [in males: 4.6, –2.4 to 11.7 (mean biases, 95% limit of agreement) at the baseline, 1.4, –7.4 to 10.2 at the endpoint, and 3.2, –4.8 to 11.3 in changes; in females: 5.1, –2.4 to 12.7; 2.2, –6.1 to 10.4; and 3.0, –4.8 to 10.7, respectively]. For males and females, %BFDXA proved to be a significant predictor of the difference between DXA and BIA at the baseline, the endpoint, and in changes when BMI and age were considered (in males: p<0.01 and R\n2  = 23.1%, 24.1%, 20.7%, respectively; for females: p<0.001 and R\n2  = 40.4%, 48.8%, 25.4%, respectively).

Since endogenous melatonin levels are already reduced at preclinical AD stages, it is important to ask whether replenishing the missing hormone would be beneficial in AD and whether any such effects would be related to the presence of sleep disorder in patients.\n\nABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The effects of add-on prolonged-release melatonin (PRM) (2 mg) to standard therapy on cognitive functioning and sleep were investigated in 80 patients (men [50.7%], women [49.3%], average age 75.3 years [range, 52–85 years]) diagnosed with mild to moderate AD, with and without insomnia comorbidity, and receiving standard therapy (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with or without memantine). In this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, patients were treated for 2 weeks with placebo and then randomized (1:1) to receive 2 mg of PRM or placebo nightly for 24 weeks, followed by 2 weeks placebo. The AD Assessment Scale–Cognition (ADAS-Cog), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), Mini–Mental State Examination (MMSE), sleep, as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and a daily sleep diary, and safety parameters were measured.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Patients treated with PRM (24 weeks) had significantly better cognitive performance than those treated with placebo, as measured by the IADL (P=0.004) and MMSE (P=0.044). Mean ADAS-Cog did not differ between the groups. Sleep efficiency, as measured by the PSQI, component 4, was also better with PRM (P=0.017). In the comorbid insomnia (PSQI ≥6) subgroup, PRM treatment resulted in significant and clinically meaningful effects versus the placebo, in mean IADL (P=0.032), MMSE score (+1.5 versus −3 points) (P=0.0177), and sleep efficiency (P=0.04). Median ADAS-Cog values (−3.5 versus +3 points) (P=0.045) were significantly better with PRM. Differences were more significant at longer treatment duration. PRM was well tolerated, with an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Add-on PRM has positive effects on cognitive functioning and sleep maintenance in AD patients compared with placebo, particularly in those with insomnia comorbidity. The results suggest a possible causal link between poor sleep and cognitive decline.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Prolonged-release melatonin\", \"Placebo\", \"IADL cognitive performance \", \"significantly increased\", \"Patients treated with PRM (24 weeks) had significantly better cognitive performance than those treated with placebo, as measured by the IADL (P=0.004) and MMSE (P=0.044).\"], [\"Prolonged-release melatonin\", \"Placebo\", \"MMSE cognitive performance \", \"significantly increased\", \"Patients treated with PRM (24 weeks) had significantly better cognitive performance than those treated with placebo, as measured by the IADL (P=0.004) and MMSE (P=0.044).\"], [\"Prolonged-release melatonin\", \"Placebo\", \"Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index sleep efficiency\", \"significantly increased\", \"Sleep efficiency, as measured by the PSQI, component 4, was also better with PRM (P=0.017).\"], [\"Prolonged-release melatonin\", \"Placebo\", \"Adverse events \", \"no significant difference\", \"Differences were more significant at longer treatment duration.

Intervention group (IG) and control group (CG) were split equally between governmental and private schools. Three educational in-person parents and children sessions were held at 2-month intervals to promote healthy eating habits and exercise. To reinforce the information, a website provided extensive discussion on a new topic every 2 weeks, including school snack menus and tools to calculate body mass index in children and adults. Text messages were sent to parents' mobile phones reinforcing the information provided. The IG contained 226 children and CG 181 children.

No trial has previously examined whether exercising to neutral or into the hypermobile range affects outcomes. This study aimed to (i) determine if a physiotherapist-prescribed exercise programme focused on knee joint strength and control is effective in reducing knee pain in children with JHS compared to no treatment, and (ii) whether the range in which these exercises are performed affects outcomes.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: A prospective, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial conducted in a tertiary hospital in Sydney, Australia compared an 8 week exercise programme performed into either the full hypermobile range or only to neutral knee extension, following a minimum 2 week baseline period without treatment. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealed by sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes. Knee pain was the primary outcome. Quality of life, thigh muscle strength, and function were also measured at (i) initial assessment, (ii) following the baseline period and (iii) post treatment. Assessors were blinded to the participants' treatment allocation and participants blinded to the difference in the treatments.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Children with JHS and knee pain (n=26) aged 7-16 years were randomly assigned to the hypermobile (n=12) or neutral (n=14) treatment group. Significant improvements in child-reported maximal knee pain were found following treatment, regardless of group allocation with a mean 14.5 mm reduction on the visual analogue scale (95% CI 5.2 – 23.8 mm, p=0.003). Significant differences between treatment groups were noted for parent-reported overall psychosocial health (p=0.009), specifically self-esteem (p=0.034), mental health (p=0.001) and behaviour (p=0.019), in favour of exercising into the hypermobile range (n=11) compared to neutral only (n=14). Conversely, parent-reported overall physical health significantly favoured exercising only to neutral (p=0.037). No other differences were found between groups and no adverse events occurred.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Parents perceive improved child psychosocial health when children exercise into the hypermobile range, while exercising to neutral only is perceived to favour the child's physical health. A physiotherapist prescribed, supervised, individualised and progressed exercise programme effectively reduces knee pain in children with JHS.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australia & New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry; ACTRN12606000109505.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"physiotherapist-prescribed exercise programme\", \"no treatment\", \"child-reported maximal knee pain\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Significant improvements in child-reported maximal knee pain were found following treatment, regardless of group allocation with a mean 14.5 mm reduction on the visual analogue scale (95% CI 5.2 \\u2013 23.8 mm, p=0.003).\"], [\"physiotherapist-prescribed exercise programme\", \"no treatment\", \"adverse events\", \"no significant difference\", \"No other differences were found between groups and no adverse events occurred.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Intervention group (IG) and control group (CG) were split equally between governmental and private schools. Three educational in-person parents and children sessions were held at 2-month intervals to promote healthy eating habits and exercise. To reinforce the information, a website provided extensive discussion on a new topic every 2 weeks, including school snack menus and tools to calculate body mass index in children and adults. Text messages were sent to parents' mobile phones reinforcing the information provided. The IG contained 226 children and CG 181 children. We measured their weight and height and calculated BMIZ at 0, 6, and 12 months.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The CG children showed a change of +0.06 (95% CI 0.01, 0.11) and +0.05 (95% CI 0.01, 0.10) in their BMIZ at 6 and 12 months, respectively. The BMIZ of IG children decreased by -0.13 (95% CI -0.19 to -0.06) and -0.10 (95% CI -0.16 to -0.03), respectively, and the effect was greater in children with obesity.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: The comprehensive intervention tested had beneficial effects, preserved the BMIZ of normal weight children, and reduced the BMIZ of children with obesity.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[[\"comprehensive intervention\", \"control group\", \"body mass index z-score\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The BMIZ of IG children decreased by -0.13 (95% CI -0.19 to -0.06) and -0.10 (95% CI -0.16 to -0.03), respectively, and the effect was greater in children with obesity.\"]]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[[\"comprehensive intervention\", \"control group\", \"body mass index z-score\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The BMIZ of IG children decreased by -0.13 (95% CI -0.19 to -0.06) and -0.10 (95% CI -0.16 to -0.03), respectively, and the effect was greater in children with obesity.\"]]"], "doc_hash": "ca0f6301125f0d3bcf7a75659e3b46d96fbb3162553d72cdd0a719c3035b315e", "prompt_hash": "bc3c3e2313d982150f5bd3f90aa80f96147154a70bcfaf62532c31abaff33afb", "target_hash": "c572ee3c6a2893a35ded528271f1c720da5db3463302405e6cb9e11cac4b4086", "bypass": null}

Furthermore, it has found application in combination with other drugs in the dermatological field and in pre-clinical studies in animal models of osteoarthritis. Experimental evidence suggests that a combination of this macromolecule with other drugs may act as a slow-release depot. However, to date, to the best of our knowledge, no one has tested local intra-articular delivery of highly cross-linked hyaluronic acid combined with bisphosphonate or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for management of knee osteoarthritis pain in the clinical setting. The aim of the present randomized double-blind study was to investigate, for the first time, the effect of a highly cross-linked hyaluronic acid, Variofill®, alone or in combination with diclofenac sodium or sodium clodronate, for management of bilateral knee osteoarthritis-related pain.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Sixty-two patients with symptomatic bilateral medial tibiofemoral knee osteoarthritis (Kellgren–Lawrence grade II and III) and pain in both knees corresponding to a daily visual analog scale (VAS) score ≥ 30 in the month before the beginning of the study were included in this investigation. Patients were divided into three groups: group 1, treated with an injection of hyaluronic acid alone (66 mg) into each knee; group 2, treated with an injection of hyaluronic acid (49.5 mg) plus diclofenac sodium (5 mg) into each knee; group 3, treated with an injection of hyaluronic acid (49.5 mg) plus sodium clodronate (5 mg) into each knee. Patients also underwent blood tests for measurement of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) immediately before and at 6-month follow-up.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Hyaluronic acid alone and in combination with sodium clodronate or diclofenac sodium produced a significant improvement in mean VAS pain score at 3 and 6-month follow-up. At 6-month follow-up, therapy with hyaluronic acid plus sodium clodronate was the most beneficial in terms of percentage improvement in VAS pain score. A significant improvement in ESR and CRP was observed at 6-month follow-up in each treatment group. No significant difference was observed when the percentage change from baseline related to these parameters was compared among the groups. No dropout was observed in any group.

Outpatient IOL is an attractive option to reduce these impacts. To date there is little data comparing outpatient and inpatient IOL methods, and potential safety concerns (hyperstimulation) if prostaglandins, the standard inpatient IOL medications, are used in the outpatient setting. The purpose of this study was to assess feasibility, clinical effectiveness and patient acceptability of outpatient Foley catheter (OPC) vs. inpatient vaginal PGE2 (IP) for induction of labour (IOL) at term.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Women with an unfavourable cervix requiring IOL at term (N = 101) were randomised to outpatient care using Foley catheter (OPC, n = 50) or inpatient care using vaginal PGE2 (IP, n = 51). OPC group had Foley catheter inserted and were discharged overnight following a reassuring cardiotocograph. IP group received 2 mg/1 mg vaginal PGE2 if nulliparous or 1 mg/1 mg if multiparous. Main outcome measures were inpatient stay (prior to birth, in Birthing Unit, total), mode of birth, induction to delivery interval, adverse reactions and patient satisfaction.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: OPC group had shorter hospital stay prior to birth (21.3 vs. 32.4 hrs, p < .001), IP were more likely to achieve vaginal birth within 12 hours of presenting to Birthing Unit (53% vs. 28%, p = .01). Vaginal birth rates (66% OPC Vs. 71% IP), total induction to delivery time (33.5 hrs vs. 31.3 hrs) and total inpatient times (96 hrs OPC Vs. 105 hrs IP) were similar. OPC group felt less pain (significant discomfort 26% Vs 58%, p = .003), and had more sleep (5.8 Vs 3.4 hours, p < .001), during cervical preparation, but were more likely to require oxytocin IOL (88 Vs 59%, p = .001).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: OPC was feasible and acceptable for IOL of women with an unfavourable cervix at term compared to IP, however did not show a statistically significant reduction in total inpatient stay and was associated with increased oxytocin IOL.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN:12609000420246.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Outpatient Foley catheter\", \"Inpatient vaginal PGE2\", \"Vaginal birth rate\", \"no significant difference\", \"Vaginal birth rates (66% OPC Vs. 71% IP), total induction to delivery time (33.5 hrs vs. 31.3 hrs) and total inpatient times (96 hrs OPC Vs. 105 hrs IP) were similar.\"], [\"Outpatient Foley catheter\", \"Inpatient vaginal PGE2\", \"Induction to delivery time\", \"no significant difference\", \").

This suggests a gap in knowledge for persons with OA regarding the many different treatments available to them.\n\nABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate outcomes after usage of a Web-based resource called My Joint Pain that contains tailored, evidence-based information and tools aimed to improve self-management of OA on self-management and change in knowledge.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: A quasi-experimental design was used to evaluate the My Joint Pain website intervention over a 12-month period. The intervention provided participants with general and user-specific information, monthly assessments with validated instruments, and progress-tracking tools. A nationwide convenience sample of 195 participants with self-assessed hip and/or knee OA completed both baseline and 12-month questionnaires (users: n=104; nonusers: n=91). The primary outcome measure was the Health Evaluation Impact Questionnaire (heiQ) to evaluate 8 different domains (health-directed activity, positive and active engagement in life, emotional distress, self-monitoring and insight, constructive attitudes and approaches, skill and technique acquisition, social integration and support, health service navigation) and the secondary outcome measure was the 17-item Osteoarthritis Quality Indicator (OAQI) questionnaire to evaluate the change in appropriateness of care received by participants. Independent t tests were used to compare changes between groups for the heiQ and chi-square tests to identify changes within and between groups from baseline to 12 months for each OAQI item.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Baseline demographics between groups were similar for gender (152/195, 77.9% female), age (mean 60, SD 9 years) and body mass index (mean 31.1, SD 6.8 kg/m2). With the exception of health service navigation, mean effect sizes from all other heiQ domains showed a positive trend for My Joint Pain users compared to the nonusers, although the differences between groups did not reach statistical significance. Within-group changes also showed improvements among the users of the My Joint Pain website for self-management (absolute change score=15%, P=.03), lifestyle (absolute change score=16%, P=.02), and physical activity (absolute change score=11%, P=.04), with no significant improvements for the nonusers. Following 12 months of exposure to the website, there were significant improvements for users compared to nonusers in self-management (absolute change score 15% vs 2%, P=.001) and weight reduction (absolute change scores 3% vs –6%, P=.03) measured on the OAQI.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: The My Joint Pain Web resource does not significantly improve overall heiQ, but does improve other important aspects of quality of care in people with hip and/or knee OA.

Fifty-six trichotillomania patients were randomly assigned to either six sessions CT or BT. Forty-eight completed their treatment. Follow-up measurements took place after a 3 months treatment-free period, and at 12 and 24 months. CT and BT both resulted in clear reductions of trichotillomania symptoms (severity, urge, inability to resist, and negative beliefs) immediately after treatment. There were no differences between the groups. Following the treatment-free period, there was a reoccurrence of symptoms. In contrast to our expectation, we failed to show that CT compared to BT resulted in lower relapse rates after the treatment-free period.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"six sessions of cognitive therapy (CT)\", \"six sessions of behaviour therapy (BT)\", \"MGHHS Massachusetts General Hospital Hair pulling Scale\", \"no significant difference\", \"CT and BT both resulted in clear reductions of trichotillomania symptoms (severity, urge, inability to resist, and negative beliefs) immediately after treatment.

This suggests a gap in knowledge for persons with OA regarding the many different treatments available to them.\n\nABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate outcomes after usage of a Web-based resource called My Joint Pain that contains tailored, evidence-based information and tools aimed to improve self-management of OA on self-management and change in knowledge.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: A quasi-experimental design was used to evaluate the My Joint Pain website intervention over a 12-month period. The intervention provided participants with general and user-specific information, monthly assessments with validated instruments, and progress-tracking tools. A nationwide convenience sample of 195 participants with self-assessed hip and/or knee OA completed both baseline and 12-month questionnaires (users: n=104; nonusers: n=91). The primary outcome measure was the Health Evaluation Impact Questionnaire (heiQ) to evaluate 8 different domains (health-directed activity, positive and active engagement in life, emotional distress, self-monitoring and insight, constructive attitudes and approaches, skill and technique acquisition, social integration and support, health service navigation) and the secondary outcome measure was the 17-item Osteoarthritis Quality Indicator (OAQI) questionnaire to evaluate the change in appropriateness of care received by participants. Independent t tests were used to compare changes between groups for the heiQ and chi-square tests to identify changes within and between groups from baseline to 12 months for each OAQI item.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Baseline demographics between groups were similar for gender (152/195, 77.9% female), age (mean 60, SD 9 years) and body mass index (mean 31.1, SD 6.8 kg/m2). With the exception of health service navigation, mean effect sizes from all other heiQ domains showed a positive trend for My Joint Pain users compared to the nonusers, although the differences between groups did not reach statistical significance. Within-group changes also showed improvements among the users of the My Joint Pain website for self-management (absolute change score=15%, P=.03), lifestyle (absolute change score=16%, P=.02), and physical activity (absolute change score=11%, P=.04), with no significant improvements for the nonusers. Following 12 months of exposure to the website, there were significant improvements for users compared to nonusers in self-management (absolute change score 15% vs 2%, P=.001) and weight reduction (absolute change scores 3% vs –6%, P=.03) measured on the OAQI.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: The My Joint Pain Web resource does not significantly improve overall heiQ, but does improve other important aspects of quality of care in people with hip and/or knee OA. Further work is required to improve engagement with the website and the quality of information delivered in order to provide a greater impact.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"My Joint Pain website intervention\", null, \"Health Evaluation Impact Questionnaire (heiQ) domains\", \"no significant difference\", \"With the exception of health service navigation, mean effect sizes from all other heiQ domains showed a positive trend for My Joint Pain users compared to the nonusers, although the differences between groups did not reach statistical significance.\"],\n    [\"My Joint Pain website intervention\", null, \"self-management\", \"significantly increased\", \"Following 12 months of exposure to the website, there were significant improvements for users compared to nonusers in self-management (absolute change score 15% vs 2%, P=.001).\"],\n    [\"My Joint Pain website intervention\", null, \"lifestyle\", \"significantly increased\", \"Following 12 months of exposure to the website, there were significant improvements for users compared to nonusers in self-management (absolute change score 16% vs 2%, P=.02).\"],\n    [\"My Joint Pain website intervention\", null, \"physical activity\", \"significantly increased\", \"Following 12 months of exposure to the website, there were significant improvements for users compared to nonusers in self-management (absolute change score 11% vs 2%, P=.04).\"],\n    [\"My Joint Pain website intervention\", null, \"weight reduction\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Following 12 months of exposure to the website, there were significant improvements for users compared to nonusers in weight reduction (absolute change scores 3% vs –6%, P=.03).\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"My Joint Pain website intervention\", null, \"Health Evaluation Impact Questionnaire (heiQ) domains\", \"no significant difference\", \"With the exception of health service navigation, mean effect sizes from all other heiQ domains showed a positive trend for My Joint Pain users compared to the nonusers, although the differences between groups did not reach statistical significance.\"],\n    [\"My Joint Pain website intervention\", null, \"self-management\", \"significantly increased\", \"Following 12 months of exposure to the website, there were significant improvements for users compared to nonusers in self-management (absolute change score 15% vs 2%, P=.001).\"],\n    [\"My Joint Pain website intervention\", null, \"lifestyle\", \"significantly increased\", \"Following 12 months of exposure to the website, there were significant improvements for users compared to nonusers in self-management (absolute change score 16% vs 2%, P=.02).\"],\n    [\"My Joint Pain website intervention\", null, \"physical activity\", \"significantly increased\", \"Following 12 months of exposure to the website, there were significant improvements for users compared to nonusers in self-management (absolute change score 11% vs 2%, P=.04).\"],\n    [\"My Joint Pain website intervention\", null, \"weight reduction\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Following 12 months of exposure to the website, there were significant improvements for users compared to nonusers in weight reduction (absolute change scores 3% vs –6%, P=.03).\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "60bbdcff520a0f6517f1616a9347060951e7db8e8d41c82fdef2107adc3a4ec3", "prompt_hash": "7e084d34b45597369d0abda2c81e36da14018cbf55cb09b81c4c874b423a7c39", "target_hash": "dc58028f23148cdf56f4e6bc62b34aa1b7eb3765dbea85b81003005f25b3fe7d", "bypass": null}

This post hoc analysis of three randomized trials evaluated whether disease duration affected responses to pramlintide.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Patients received mealtime pramlintide 30 or 60 μg (n = 714) or placebo (n = 537) as an adjunct to insulin and were stratified into tertiles by diabetes duration at baseline. Efficacy and safety end points were assessed at week 26 using analysis of covariance and logistic regression models.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Disease durations for tertiles 1, 2, and 3 were 6.7, 16.5, and 29.9 years, respectively. In all tertiles, pramlintide resulted in greater reductions in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and weight than placebo, with greater weight reductions and insulin sparing in tertiles 2 and 3. Insulin dose and weight increased in the placebo group in all tertiles. Baseline HbA1c was a predictor of HbA1c lowering in both treatment groups (P < 0.0001); higher daily insulin predicted a smaller percent increase in insulin dose for placebo (P = 0.01); and higher body weight predicted greater weight loss in both pramlintide- and placebo-treated patients (P < 0.05). Event rates for severe hypoglycemia were similar for pramlintide and placebo and increased with longer duration of diabetes for both groups. Nausea with pramlintide increased with longer disease duration.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Mealtime pramlintide resulted in greater reductions in HbA1c than placebo, regardless of diabetes duration at baseline. Longer disease duration appeared to augment insulin sparing and weight loss with pramlintide, with a potential for increased incidence of hypoglycemia and nausea.\n\nABSTRACT.FUNDING: The design and conduct of the study were supported by Amylin Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA, USA.\n\nABSTRACT.ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s12325-016-0326-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"Pramlintide \", \"Placebo\", \"Weight \", \"significantly decreased\", \"pramlintide resulted in greater reductions in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and weight than placebo\"], [\"Pramlintide \", \"Placebo\", \"Severe hypoglycemia \", \"no significant difference\", \"Event rates for severe hypoglycemia were similar for pramlintide and placebo\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:180"}, "target": "[[\"Pramlintide \", \"Placebo\", \"Weight \", \"significantly decreased\", \"pramlintide resulted in greater reductions in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and weight than placebo\"], [\"Pramlintide \", \"Placebo\", \"Severe hypoglycemia \", \"no significant difference\", \"Event rates for severe hypoglycemia were similar for pramlintide and placebo\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

SASA!, a phased community mobilization intervention, engages communities to prevent IPV and promote gender equity. The SASA! study assessed the community-level impact of SASA! on reported HIV-related risk behaviours and relationship dynamics.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Data were collected as part of a cluster randomized controlled trial conducted between 2007 and 2012 in eight communities in Kampala. An adjusted cluster-level intention to treat analysis, compares secondary outcomes in intervention and control communities at follow-up. The qualitative evaluation explored participants' subjective experience of SASA!. A total of 82 in-depth interviews were audio recorded at follow-up, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Men in intervention communities were significantly more likely than controls to report a broad range of HIV-protective behaviours, including higher levels of condom use (aRR 2.03, 95% CI 1.22–3.39), HIV testing (aRR 1.50, 95% CI 1.13–2.00) and fewer concurrent partners (aRR 0.60, 95% CI 0.37–0.97). They were also more likely to report increased joint decision-making (aRR 1.92, 95% CI 1.27–2.91), greater male participation in household tasks (aRR 1.48, 95% CI 1.09–2.01), more open communication and greater appreciation of their partner's work inside (aRR 1.31, 95% CI 1.04–1.66) and outside (aRR 1.49, 95% CI 1.08–2.06) the home. For women, all outcomes were in the hypothesized direction, but effect sizes were smaller. Only some achieved statistical significance. Women in intervention communities were significantly more likely to report being able to refuse sex with their partners (aRR 1.16, 95% CI 1.00–1.35), joint decision-making (aRR 1.37, 95% CI 1.06–1.78) and more open communication on a number of indicators. Qualitative interviews suggest that shifts operated through broader improvements in relationships, including increased trust and cooperation, participants' greater awareness of the connections between HIV and IPV and their resultant desire to improve their relationships. Barriers to change include partial uptake of SASA!, partner resistance, fear and entrenched previous beliefs.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: SASA! impacted positively on reported HIV-related risk behaviours and relationship dynamics at a community level, especially among men.

Deliberate restriction of food intake (dieting) produces short-term weight loss but is largely unsuccessful for long-term weight management. Two promising approaches for the prevention of weight gain are intuitive eating (ie, eating in accordance with hunger and satiety signals) and the development of greater psychological flexibility (ie, the aim of acceptance and commitment therapy [ACT]).\n\nABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES: This pilot study investigated the usage, acceptability, and feasibility of \"Mind, Body, Food,\" a Web-based weight gain prevention intervention prototype that teaches intuitive eating and psychological flexibility skills.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Participants were 40 overweight women (mean age 44.8 [standard deviation, SD, 3.06] years, mean body mass index [BMI] 32.9 [SD 6.01] kg/m2, mean Intuitive Eating Scale [IES-1] total score 53.4 [SD 7.46], classified as below average) who were recruited from the general population in Dunedin, New Zealand. Module completion and study site metrics were assessed using Google Analytics. Use of an online self-monitoring tool was determined by entries saved to a secure online database. Intervention acceptability was assessed postintervention. BMI, intuitive eating, binge eating, psychological flexibility, and general mental and physical health were assessed pre- and postintervention and 3-months postintervention.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Of the 40 women enrolled in the study, 12 (30%) completed all 12 modules (median 7.5 [interquartile range, IQR, 2-12] modules) and 4 (10%) used the self-monitoring tool for all 14 weeks of the intervention period (median 3 [IQR 1-9] weeks). Among 26 women who completed postintervention assessments, most women rated \"Mind, Body, Food\" as useful (20/26, 77%), easy to use (17/25, 68%) and liked the intervention (22/25, 88%). From pre- to postintervention, there were statistically significant within-group increases in intuitive eating (IES-2 total score P<.001; all IES-2 subscale scores: P ≤.01), psychological flexibility (P=.01), and general mental health (P<.001) as well as significant decreases in binge eating (P=.01).

At the time of this study, artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and chlorproguanil-dapsone (CPD), both multi-dose regimes, were considered possible alternatives to SP in Malawi. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of poor adherence on the effectiveness of AL and CPD.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Children ≥12 months and adults with uncomplicated malaria were randomized to receive AL, CPD or SP. Adherence was measured using a questionnaire and electronic monitoring devices, MEMSTM, pill bottles that recorded the date and time of opening. Day-7 plasma dapsone or lumefantrine concentrations were measured to examine their relationship with adherence and clinical response.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: 841 patients were recruited. The day-28 adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) rates, using intention to treat analysis (missing data treated as failure), were AL 85.2%, CPD 63.7% and SP 50%. ACPR rates for AL were higher than CPD or SP on days 28 and 42 (p ≤ 0.002 for all comparisons). CPD was more effective than SP on day-28 (p = 0.01), but not day-42. <p> Very high adherence was reported using the questionnaire, 100% for AL treated patients and 99.2% for the CPD group. Only three CPD participants admitted missing any doses. 164/181 (90.6%) of CPD treated patients took all their doses out of the MEMSTM container and they were more likely to have a day-28 ACPR than those who did not take all their medication out of the container, p = 0.024. Only 7/87 (8%) AL treated patients did not take all of their doses out of their MEMSTM container and none had treatment failure. <p> Median day-7 dapsone concentrations were higher in CPD treated patients with ACPR than in treatment failures, p = 0.012. There were no differences in day-7 dapsone or lumefantrine concentrations between those who took all their doses from the MEMSTM container and those who did not. A day-7 lumefantrine concentration reported to be predictive of AL treatment failure in Thailand was not useful in this population; only one of 16 participants with a concentration below this threshold (175 ng/ml) had treatment failure.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: This study provides reassurance of the effectiveness of AL, even with unsupervised dosing, as it is rolled out across sub-Saharan Africa. Self-reported adherence appears to be an unreliable measure of adherence in this population.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Chlorproguanil-dapsone (CPD)\", \"Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) \", \"Effectiveness at day 28\", \"significantly increased\", \"CPD was more effective than SP on day-28 (p = 0.01), but not day-42.\"], [\"Chlorproguanil-dapsone (CPD)\", \"Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) \", \"Effectiveness at day 42\", \"no significant difference\", \"CPD was more effective than SP on day-28 (p = 0.01), but not day-42.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Deliberate restriction of food intake (dieting) produces short-term weight loss but is largely unsuccessful for long-term weight management. Two promising approaches for the prevention of weight gain are intuitive eating (ie, eating in accordance with hunger and satiety signals) and the development of greater psychological flexibility (ie, the aim of acceptance and commitment therapy [ACT]).\n\nABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES: This pilot study investigated the usage, acceptability, and feasibility of \"Mind, Body, Food,\" a Web-based weight gain prevention intervention prototype that teaches intuitive eating and psychological flexibility skills.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Participants were 40 overweight women (mean age 44.8 [standard deviation, SD, 3.06] years, mean body mass index [BMI] 32.9 [SD 6.01] kg/m2, mean Intuitive Eating Scale [IES-1] total score 53.4 [SD 7.46], classified as below average) who were recruited from the general population in Dunedin, New Zealand. Module completion and study site metrics were assessed using Google Analytics. Use of an online self-monitoring tool was determined by entries saved to a secure online database. Intervention acceptability was assessed postintervention. BMI, intuitive eating, binge eating, psychological flexibility, and general mental and physical health were assessed pre- and postintervention and 3-months postintervention.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Of the 40 women enrolled in the study, 12 (30%) completed all 12 modules (median 7.5 [interquartile range, IQR, 2-12] modules) and 4 (10%) used the self-monitoring tool for all 14 weeks of the intervention period (median 3 [IQR 1-9] weeks). Among 26 women who completed postintervention assessments, most women rated \"Mind, Body, Food\" as useful (20/26, 77%), easy to use (17/25, 68%) and liked the intervention (22/25, 88%). From pre- to postintervention, there were statistically significant within-group increases in intuitive eating (IES-2 total score P<.001; all IES-2 subscale scores: P ≤.01), psychological flexibility (P=.01), and general mental health (P<.001) as well as significant decreases in binge eating (P=.01). At the 3-month follow-up, IES-2 improvements were maintained, and there were further improvements in binge eating (P<.001) and general mental health (P=.03), and a marginal yet nonsignificant tendency for further improvement in psychological flexibility (P=.06). There were no significant within-group changes in BMI from pre- to postintervention and postintervention to 3-month follow-up (P=.46 and P=.93, respectively).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: The \"Mind, Body, Food\" prototype Web-based intervention is appealing to middle-aged women and may be a useful tool to help women learn intuitive eating and ACT skills, reduce binge eating, and maintain weight over 3 months.

This study compared the efficacy and safety of once-daily (OD) and twice-daily (BID) glycopyrronium bromide regimens, using a novel model-based approach, in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Double-blind, randomized, dose-finding trial with an eight-treatment, two-period, balanced incomplete block design. Patients (smoking history ≥10 pack-years, post-bronchodilator FEV1 ≥30% and <80% predicted, FEV1/FVC <0.7) were randomized to one of 16 independent sequences for 28 days. Primary endpoint: mean trough FEV1 at Day 28.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: 385 patients (mean age 61.2 years; mean post-bronchodilator FEV1 53% predicted) were randomized; 88.6% completed. All OD and BID dosing regimens produced dose-dependent bronchodilation; at Day 28, increases in mean trough FEV1 versus placebo were statistically significant for all regimens, ranging from 51 mL (glycopyrronium bromide 12.5 μg OD) to 160 mL (glycopyrronium bromide 50 μg BID). Pharmacodynamic steady-state was reached by Day 7. There was a small separation (≤37 mL) between BID and OD dose–response curves for mean trough FEV1 at steady-state in favour of BID dosing. Over 24 hours, separation between OD and BID regimens was even smaller (FEV1 AUC0-24h maximum difference for equivalent daily dose regimens: 8 mL). Dose–response results for FEV1 at 12 hours, FEV1 AUC0-12h and FEV1 AUC0-4h at steady-state showed OD regimens provided greater improvement over placebo than BID regimens for total daily doses of 25 μg, 50 μg and 100 μg, while the reverse was true for OD versus BID regimens from 12–24 hours. The 12.5 μg BID dose produced a marginally higher improvement in trough FEV1 versus placebo than 50 μg OD, however, the response at 12 hours over placebo was suboptimal (74 mL). Glycopyrronium bromide was safe and well tolerated at all doses.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Glycopyrronium bromide 50 μg OD provides significant bronchodilation over a 24 hour period, and in terms of FEV1 AUC0-24h is not significantly different than the same total daily dose administered BID. Importantly, OD dosing may confer better patient adherence. The results are consistent with previous glycopyrronium bromide studies and support once-daily dosing of glycopyrronium bromide 50 μg in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01119950\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"Glycopyrronium bromide 12.5 \\u03bcg OD\", \"Placebo\", \"FEV1\", \"significantly increased\", \"increases in mean trough FEV1 versus placebo were statistically significant for all regimens, ranging from 51 mL (glycopyrronium bromide 12.5 \\u03bcg OD) to 160 mL (glycopyrronium bromide 50 \\u03bcg BID).\"], [\"Glycopyrronium bromide 50 \\u03bcg BID\", \"Placebo\", \"FEV1\", \"significantly increased\", \"increases in mean trough FEV1 versus placebo were statistically significant for all regimens, ranging from 51 mL (glycopyrronium bromide 12.5 \\u03bcg OD) to 160 mL (glycopyrronium bromide 50 \\u03bcg BID).\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:182"}, "target": "[[\"Glycopyrronium bromide 12.5 \\u03bcg OD\", \"Placebo\", \"FEV1\", \"significantly increased\", \"increases in mean trough FEV1 versus placebo were statistically significant for all regimens, ranging from 51 mL (glycopyrronium bromide 12.5 \\u03bcg OD) to 160 mL (glycopyrronium bromide 50 \\u03bcg BID).\"], [\"Glycopyrronium bromide 50 \\u03bcg BID\", \"Placebo\", \"FEV1\", \"significantly increased\", \"increases in mean trough FEV1 versus placebo were statistically significant for all regimens, ranging from 51 mL (glycopyrronium bromide 12.5 \\u03bcg OD) to 160 mL (glycopyrronium bromide 50 \\u03bcg BID).\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

Patients were randomized into 2 groups. Group 1 (n=60) received 5 mg solifenacin per day, while Group 2 (n=59) received 4 mg fesoterodine per day. All the patients' OAB symptom scores (OABSS) in weeks 0, 4, and 12 were recorded. In addition, treatment costs and side effects of the drugs were evaluated.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: Average OABSS (score 1) was determined as: 9.5 ± 2.8 for Group 1 and 10.7 ± 1.8 for Group 2 at week 0; 2.2 ± 1.2 (Group 1) and 2.4 ± 1.3 (Group 2) at week 4 (score 2); and 1.3 ± 0.5 for Group 1 and 1.3 ± 0.6 for Group 2 at week 12 (score 3).

Primary endpoint: mean trough FEV1 at Day 28.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: 385 patients (mean age 61.2 years; mean post-bronchodilator FEV1 53% predicted) were randomized; 88.6% completed. All OD and BID dosing regimens produced dose-dependent bronchodilation; at Day 28, increases in mean trough FEV1 versus placebo were statistically significant for all regimens, ranging from 51 mL (glycopyrronium bromide 12.5 μg OD) to 160 mL (glycopyrronium bromide 50 μg BID). Pharmacodynamic steady-state was reached by Day 7. There was a small separation (≤37 mL) between BID and OD dose–response curves for mean trough FEV1 at steady-state in favour of BID dosing. Over 24 hours, separation between OD and BID regimens was even smaller (FEV1 AUC0-24h maximum difference for equivalent daily dose regimens: 8 mL). Dose–response results for FEV1 at 12 hours, FEV1 AUC0-12h and FEV1 AUC0-4h at steady-state showed OD regimens provided greater improvement over placebo than BID regimens for total daily doses of 25 μg, 50 μg and 100 μg, while the reverse was true for OD versus BID regimens from 12–24 hours. The 12.5 μg BID dose produced a marginally higher improvement in trough FEV1 versus placebo than 50 μg OD, however, the response at 12 hours over placebo was suboptimal (74 mL). Glycopyrronium bromide was safe and well tolerated at all doses.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Glycopyrronium bromide 50 μg OD provides significant bronchodilation over a 24 hour period, and in terms of FEV1 AUC0-24h is not significantly different than the same total daily dose administered BID. Importantly, OD dosing may confer better patient adherence. The results are consistent with previous glycopyrronium bromide studies and support once-daily dosing of glycopyrronium bromide 50 μg in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01119950\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"glycopyrronium bromide 50 μg OD\", \"glycopyrronium bromide 50 μg BID\", \"mean trough FEV1 at Day 28\", \"significantly increased\", \"at Day 28, increases in mean trough FEV1 versus placebo were statistically significant for all regimens, ranging from 51 mL (glycopyrronium bromide 12.5 μg OD) to 160 mL (glycopyrronium bromide 50 μg BID).\"],\n    [\"glycopyrronium bromide 50 μg OD\", \"glycopyrronium bromide 50 μg BID\", \"FEV1 AUC0-24h\", \"no significant difference\", \"in terms of FEV1 AUC0-24h is not significantly different than the same total daily dose administered BID.\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"glycopyrronium bromide 50 μg OD\", \"glycopyrronium bromide 50 μg BID\", \"mean trough FEV1 at Day 28\", \"significantly increased\", \"at Day 28, increases in mean trough FEV1 versus placebo were statistically significant for all regimens, ranging from 51 mL (glycopyrronium bromide 12.5 μg OD) to 160 mL (glycopyrronium bromide 50 μg BID).\"],\n    [\"glycopyrronium bromide 50 μg OD\", \"glycopyrronium bromide 50 μg BID\", \"FEV1 AUC0-24h\", \"no significant difference\", \"in terms of FEV1 AUC0-24h is not significantly different than the same total daily dose administered BID.\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "883d3d09b6f53245859b92d69b0e91054d34267a38ef91ae181008d3728c3fde", "prompt_hash": "8729ffeeac6e2b585e29fb61b62ec75f892df79622b744c260ba2d2806625374", "target_hash": "2bd08c7d850f8227637128dd48105fe6ad495a5909cfaa8b774c06299754010c", "bypass": null}

All patients underwent a diagnostic cystoscopy. Patients were then randomized into 2 groups: One group that did not receive antibiotics (100 patients) and the other group that received antibiotic treatment (100 patients with a single intravenous dose of cefoperazone). All patients had urine analysis and urine cultures on the second day after the operation. Additionally, clinical parameters including fever and dysuria were recorded. In 15% of the patients, incidental additional interventions such as punch biopsy or TUR of a small bladder tumor that were similarly distributed in both groups were performed.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: In 1 patient from the antibiotic group and 2 patients from the no prophylaxis group, the urine cultures after cystoscopy were positive. No statistically significant difference was observed between these groups based on the microbiological and clinical parameters.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: The current study provides evidence that no antibiotic prophylaxis is required before diagnostic cystoscopy in patients without bacteriuria.

The proportion of affected patients, the optimum follow-up period and whether there are differences between drugs in the development of this complication remain to be ascertained.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, phase IV, controlled, crossover study we recruited 30 patients with stage 3 CKD under restrictive eligibility criteria and strict dietary control. With the exception of withdrawals, each patient was treated with olmesartan and enalapril separately for 3 months each, with a 1-week wash-out period between treatments. Patients were clinically assessed on 10 occasions via measurements of serum and urine samples. We used the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel statistics for comparison of categorical data between groups. Comparisons were also made using independent two-sample t-tests and Welch's t-test. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed when necessary. We used either a Mann–Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis test if the distribution was not normal or the variance not homogeneous.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Enalapril and olmesartan increased serum potassium levels similarly (0.3 mmol/L and 0.24 mmol/L respectively). The percentage of patients presenting hyperkalemia higher than 5 mmol/L did not differ between treatments: 37% for olmesartan and 40% for enalapril. The mean e-GFR ranged 46.3 to 48.59 ml/mint/1.73 m2 in those treated with olmesartan and 46.8 to 48.3 ml/mint/1.73 m2 in those with enalapril and remained unchanged at the end of the study. The decreases in microalbuminuria were also similar (23% in olmesartan and 29% in enalapril patients) in the 4 weeks time point. The percentage of patients presenting hyperkalemia, even after a two month period, did not differ between treatments. There were no appreciable changes in sodium and potassium urinary excretion.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Disturbances in potassium balance upon treatment with either olmesartan or enalapril are frequent and without differences between groups.

The objective of the Syndromic Surveillance Evaluation Study was to develop and implement standardized supports in local public health agencies in Ontario, Canada, and evaluate the ability of these supports to affect actions taken as part of public health communicable disease control programs.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Local public health agencies (LPHA) in Ontario, which used syndromic surveillance based on emergency department visits for respiratory disease, were recruited and randomly allocated to the study intervention or control group. The intervention group health agencies received standardized supports in terms of a standardized aberrant event detection algorithm and a response protocol dictating steps to investigate and assess the public health significance of syndromic surveillance alerts. The control group continued with their pre-existing syndromic surveillance infrastructure and processes. Outcomes were assessed using logbooks, which collected quantitative and qualitative information about alerts received, investigation steps taken, and public health responses. The study was conducted prospectively for 15 months (October 2013 to February 2015).\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Fifteen LPHAs participated in the study (n = 9 intervention group, n = 6 control group). A total of 1,969 syndromic surveillance alerts were received by all LPHAs. Variations in the types and amount of responses varied by LPHA, in particularly differences were noted by the size of the health unit. Smaller health units had more challenges to both detect and mount a response to any alerts. LPHAs in the control group were more likely to declare alerts to have public health significance and to initiate any action. Regression models using repeated measures showed an interaction between the year (Year 1 versus Year 2) and the intervention as well as an interaction between year and sustained nature of the alert. Both of these were linked to the control health units reporting more \"watchful waiting\".\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: This study raises questions about the effectiveness of using standardized protocols to improve the performance of syndromic surveillance in a decentralized public health system. Despite efforts to create standardized protocols and engage public health agencies in the process, no significant differences in the effective use of syndromic alerts were observed beyond year 1. It also raises questions about the minimum capacity of the agency and minimum population size that are required for an effective response.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Standardized aberrant event detection algorithm and response protocol\", \"Pre-existing syndromic surveillance infrastructure and processes\", \"Effective use of syndromic alerts after 1 year\", \"no significant difference\", \"Despite efforts to create standardized protocols and engage public health agencies in the process, no significant differences in the effective use of syndromic alerts were observed beyond year 1.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

The percentage of patients presenting hyperkalemia higher than 5 mmol/L did not differ between treatments: 37% for olmesartan and 40% for enalapril. The mean e-GFR ranged 46.3 to 48.59 ml/mint/1.73 m2 in those treated with olmesartan and 46.8 to 48.3 ml/mint/1.73 m2 in those with enalapril and remained unchanged at the end of the study. The decreases in microalbuminuria were also similar (23% in olmesartan and 29% in enalapril patients) in the 4 weeks time point. The percentage of patients presenting hyperkalemia, even after a two month period, did not differ between treatments. There were no appreciable changes in sodium and potassium urinary excretion.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Disturbances in potassium balance upon treatment with either olmesartan or enalapril are frequent and without differences between groups. The follow-up of these patients should include control of potassium levels, at least after the first week and the first and second month after initiating treatment.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial EudraCT \"2008-002191-98\".\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"Olmesartan\", \"Enalapril\", \"Serum potassium levels\", \"significantly increased\", \"Enalapril and olmesartan increased serum potassium levels similarly (0.3 mmol/L and 0.24 mmol/L respectively).\"],\n    [\"Olmesartan\", \"Enalapril\", \"Percentage of patients presenting hyperkalemia > 5 mmol/L\", \"no significant difference\", \"The percentage of patients presenting hyperkalemia higher than 5 mmol/L did not differ between treatments: 37% for olmesartan and 40% for enalapril.\"],\n    [\"Olmesartan\", \"Enalapril\", \"Microalbuminuria\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The decreases in microalbuminuria were also similar (23% in olmesartan and 29% in enalapril patients) in the 4 weeks time point.\"],\n    [null, null, \"Sodium and potassium urinary excretion\", \"no significant difference\", \"There were no appreciable changes in sodium and potassium urinary excretion.\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"Olmesartan\", \"Enalapril\", \"Serum potassium levels\", \"significantly increased\", \"Enalapril and olmesartan increased serum potassium levels similarly (0.3 mmol/L and 0.24 mmol/L respectively).\"],\n    [\"Olmesartan\", \"Enalapril\", \"Percentage of patients presenting hyperkalemia > 5 mmol/L\", \"no significant difference\", \"The percentage of patients presenting hyperkalemia higher than 5 mmol/L did not differ between treatments: 37% for olmesartan and 40% for enalapril.\"],\n    [\"Olmesartan\", \"Enalapril\", \"Microalbuminuria\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The decreases in microalbuminuria were also similar (23% in olmesartan and 29% in enalapril patients) in the 4 weeks time point.\"],\n    [null, null, \"Sodium and potassium urinary excretion\", \"no significant difference\", \"There were no appreciable changes in sodium and potassium urinary excretion.\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "af67b11918758d13a1a43b812222d1c928cab1ec661d1c74be18031bbc914600", "prompt_hash": "19204b42dd5c8e9005634bd6e42e86857b63d1a750da2bbf5b8d48809f87b577", "target_hash": "79a71d04649b70f7596f5406b99fbe7db1e8e5df029028319f01d5da5c4354e4", "bypass": null}

Ten experienced, college-aged men performed four protocols (one per week): no-exercise seated control (CTRL), virtual drumming on a handheld gaming device (HANDHELD), active drumming on drum pads (DRUM), and walking on a treadmill at ~30% of VO2max (WALK). Protocols were performed after an overnight fast, and expired air was collected continuously during (30min) and after (30min) exercise. DRUM and HANDHELD song lists, day of the week, and time of day were identical for each participant. Significant differences (p < 0.05) among the average rates of energy expenditure (kcal·min−1) during activity included WALK > DRUM > HANDHELD. No significant differences in the rates of energy expenditure among groups during recovery were observed. Total energy expenditure was significantly greater (p < 0.05) during WALK (149.5 ± 30.6 kcal) compared to DRUM (118.7 ± 18.8 kcal) and HANDHELD (44.9±11.6 kcal), and greater during DRUM compared to HANDHELD. Total energy expenditure was not significantly different between HANDHELD (44.9 ± 11.6 kcal) and CTRL (38.2 ± 6.0 kcal). Active video game drumming at expert-level significantly increased energy expenditure compared to handheld, but it hardly met moderate-intensity activity standards, and energy expenditure was greatest during walking. Energy expenditure with handheld video game drumming was not different from no-exercise control. Thus, traditional aerobic exercise remains at the forefront for achieving the minimum amount and intensity of physical activity for health, individuals desiring to use video games for achieving weekly physical activity recommendations should choose games that require significant involvement of lower-body musculature, and time spent playing sedentary games should be a limited part of an active lifestyle.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"Walking\", \"Drumming on drum pads\", \"Total energy expenditure\", \"significantly increased\", \"Total energy expenditure was significantly greater (p \\u003c 0.05) during WALK (149.5 \\u00b1 30.6 kcal) compared to DRUM (118.7 \\u00b1 18.8 kcal) and HANDHELD (44.9\\u00b111.6 kcal), and greater during DRUM compared to HANDHELD.\"], [\"Walking\", \"Virtual drumming\", \"Total energy expenditure\", \"significantly increased\", \"Total energy expenditure was significantly greater (p \\u003c 0.05) during WALK (149.5 \\u00b1 30.6 kcal) compared to DRUM (118.7 \\u00b1 18.8 kcal) and HANDHELD (44.9\\u00b111.6 kcal), and greater during DRUM compared to HANDHELD.\"], [\"Drumming on drum pads\", \"Virtual drumming \", \"Total energy expenditure\", \"significantly increased\", \"Total energy expenditure was significantly greater (p \\u003c 0.05) during WALK (149.5 \\u00b1 30.6 kcal) compared to DRUM (118.7 \\u00b1 18.8 kcal) and HANDHELD (44.9\\u00b111.6 kcal), and greater during DRUM compared to HANDHELD.\"], [\"Virtual drumming \", \"Control\", \"Total energy expenditure\", \"no significant difference\", \"Total energy expenditure was not significantly different between HANDHELD (44.9 \\u00b1 11.6 kcal) and CTRL (38.2 \\u00b1 6.0 kcal).\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:185"}, "target": "[[\"Walking\", \"Drumming on drum pads\", \"Total energy expenditure\", \"significantly increased\", \"Total energy expenditure was significantly greater (p \\u003c 0.05) during WALK (149.5 \\u00b1 30.6 kcal) compared to DRUM (118.7 \\u00b1 18.8 kcal) and HANDHELD (44.9\\u00b111.6 kcal), and greater during DRUM compared to HANDHELD.\"], [\"Walking\", \"Virtual drumming\", \"Total energy expenditure\", \"significantly increased\", \"Total energy expenditure was significantly greater (p \\u003c 0.05) during WALK (149.5 \\u00b1 30.6 kcal) compared to DRUM (118.7 \\u00b1 18.8 kcal) and HANDHELD (44.9\\u00b111.6 kcal), and greater during DRUM compared to HANDHELD.\"], [\"Drumming on drum pads\", \"Virtual drumming \", \"Total energy expenditure\", \"significantly increased\", \"Total energy expenditure was significantly greater (p \\u003c 0.05) during WALK (149.5 \\u00b1 30.6 kcal) compared to DRUM (118.7 \\u00b1 18.8 kcal) and HANDHELD (44.9\\u00b111.6 kcal), and greater during DRUM compared to HANDHELD.\"], [\"Virtual drumming \", \"Control\", \"Total energy expenditure\", \"no significant difference\", \"Total energy expenditure was not significantly different between HANDHELD (44.9 \\u00b1 11.6 kcal) and CTRL (38.2 \\u00b1 6.0 kcal).\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

Their effectiveness is reported to be similar, and therefore the costs of treatment represent a major issue to be considered. Although several studies about costs in IVF have been published, data obtained in low-technology infertility treatments are still scarce.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Two hundred and sixty infertile women (184 with unexplained infertility, 76 with CC-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome) at their first treatment cycle were randomized and included in the study. Ovulation induction was accomplished by daily administration of rFSH or HP-uFSH according to a low-dose, step-up regimen aimed to obtain a monofollicular ovulation. A bi- or tri-follicular ovulation was anyway accepted, whereas hCG was withdrawn and the cycle cancelled when more than three follicles greater than or equal to 18 mm diameter were seen at ultrasound. The primary outcome measure was the cost of therapy per delivered baby, estimated according to a cost-minimization analysis. Secondary outcomes were the following: monofollicular ovulation rate, total FSH dose, cycle cancellation rate, length of the follicular phase, number of developing follicles (>12 mm diameter), endometrial thickness at hCG, incidence of twinning and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, delivery rate.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The overall FSH dose needed to achieve ovulation was significantly lower with r-FSH, whereas all the other studied variables did not significantly differ with either treatments. However, a trend toward a higher delivery rate with r-FSH was observed in the whole group and also when results were considered subgrouping patients according to the indication to treatment.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Considering the significantly lower number of vials/patient and the slight (although non-significant) increase in the delivery rate with r-FSH, the cost-minimization analysis showed a 9.4% reduction in the overall therapy cost per born baby in favor of r-FSH.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"recombinant FSH (r-FSH)\", \"highly-purified, urinary FSH (HP-uFSH)\", \"total FSH dose\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The overall FSH dose needed to achieve ovulation was significantly lower with r-FSH,\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:186"}, "target": "[[\"recombinant FSH (r-FSH)\", \"highly-purified, urinary FSH (HP-uFSH)\", \"total FSH dose\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The overall FSH dose needed to achieve ovulation was significantly lower with r-FSH,\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

The primary endpoint was the percent change in body weight from baseline through Week 12.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Canagliflozin increased urinary glucose excretion in a dose-dependent manner and produced statistically significant reductions in body weight compared with placebo (least squares mean percent changes from baseline of −2.2%, −2.9%, −2.7%, and −1.3% with canagliflozin 50, 100, and 300 mg and placebo; P < 0.05 for all comparisons). Overall adverse event (AE) rates were similar across groups. Canagliflozin was associated with higher rates of genital mycotic infections in women, which were generally mild and led to few study discontinuations.

Their effectiveness is reported to be similar, and therefore the costs of treatment represent a major issue to be considered. Although several studies about costs in IVF have been published, data obtained in low-technology infertility treatments are still scarce.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Two hundred and sixty infertile women (184 with unexplained infertility, 76 with CC-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome) at their first treatment cycle were randomized and included in the study. Ovulation induction was accomplished by daily administration of rFSH or HP-uFSH according to a low-dose, step-up regimen aimed to obtain a monofollicular ovulation. A bi- or tri-follicular ovulation was anyway accepted, whereas hCG was withdrawn and the cycle cancelled when more than three follicles greater than or equal to 18 mm diameter were seen at ultrasound. The primary outcome measure was the cost of therapy per delivered baby, estimated according to a cost-minimization analysis. Secondary outcomes were the following: monofollicular ovulation rate, total FSH dose, cycle cancellation rate, length of the follicular phase, number of developing follicles (>12 mm diameter), endometrial thickness at hCG, incidence of twinning and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, delivery rate.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The overall FSH dose needed to achieve ovulation was significantly lower with r-FSH, whereas all the other studied variables did not significantly differ with either treatments. However, a trend toward a higher delivery rate with r-FSH was observed in the whole group and also when results were considered subgrouping patients according to the indication to treatment.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Considering the significantly lower number of vials/patient and the slight (although non-significant) increase in the delivery rate with r-FSH, the cost-minimization analysis showed a 9.4% reduction in the overall therapy cost per born baby in favor of r-FSH.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[[\"r-FSH\", \"HP-uFSH\", \"cost of therapy per delivered baby\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The overall FSH dose needed to achieve ovulation was significantly lower with r-FSH, whereas all the other studied variables did not significantly differ with either treatments.

The present study is aimed at assessing ginger supplement and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on inflammatory indices contributing to atherosclerosis in overweight women.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:: The present study is a randomized, experimental, and controlled one in which thirty healthy overweight women aged 20–30 years were randomly divided into three equal groups, namely, ginger, ginger + HIIT, and placebo + HIIT. The training groups performed high-intensity interval exercises (i.e. 40-m maximal shuttle run) for ten consecutive weeks. The supplement groups daily took 3 g of ginger pills and the third group took placebo.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: Paired t-test revealed a significant decrease in the density of type 1 monocytes chemo tactic protein (MCP-1) in HIIT + ginger (P = 0.026) and HIIT + placebo (P = 0.001) groups. Besides, maximum aerobic capacity in the two training groups significantly increased P = 0.002 and P = 0.000, respectively. In spite of this, analysis of variance showed no significant differences in three groups regarding the three indices such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (P = 0.093), MCP-1(P = 0.075), and serum interleukin-10 (IL-10) (P = 0.164).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: A 10-week intensive interval exercise, by itself or together with ginger supplement, improved MCP-1 and maximum oxygen consumption in overweight women, without any significant effect on soluble ICAM-1 and IL-10.

Dietary fat intake is of particular interest due to strong associations with pathophysiology. In epidemiological trials phospholipid fatty acid composition may reflect composition of habitual diet, although strong correlations have been identified only for essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Preliminary evidence shows that saturated fatty acids (SFA) C15:0 and C17:0 may be acceptable biomarkers. This study measured changes in erythrocyte membrane fatty acids during a period of strictly controlled fat feeding to investigate their use as a short-term marker of compliance, particularly for intake of SFAs.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: This was a randomised cross-over trial in which diet was provided and strictly controlled. 20 healthy, male subjects were given a 40 energy % (en%) fat diet, high in saturated (high-SFA, 20 en%) or unsaturated (high-USFA, 24 en%) fatty acids for 2 periods of 3 weeks. Subjects were residential during intervention with all food and beverages provided. Dietary composition was verified by direct chemical analysis. Blood samples were collected on days 1,7,14, 21 and analysed for red blood cell (RBC) membrane fatty acid composition. Pearson correlation showed RBC fatty acid composition to mimic dietary composition by 3 weeks, but the relationships were weak. Of the SFAs only RBC C16:0 decreased in response to decreased dietary content on high-USFA treatment (ANOVA, diet, P < 0.05).

This study examined whether the adverse effects of ketamine on oculomotor performance can be reversed by the atypical antipsychotic risperidone. In this randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 72 healthy participants performed smooth pursuit eye movements (SPEM), prosaccades (PS) and antisaccades (AS) while being randomly assigned to one of four drug groups (intravenous 100 ng ml−1 ketamine, 2 mg oral risperidone, 100 ng ml−1 ketamine plus 2 mg oral risperidone, placebo). Drug administration did not lead to harmful adverse events. Ketamine increased saccadic frequency and decreased velocity gain of SPEM (all P<0.01) but had no significant effects on PS or AS (all P⩾0.07). An effect of risperidone was observed for amplitude gain and peak velocity of PS and AS, indicating hypometric gain and slower velocities compared with placebo (both P⩽0.04). No ketamine by risperidone interactions were found (all P⩾0.26). The results confirm that the administration of ketamine produces oculomotor performance deficits similar in part to those seen in schizophrenia. The atypical antipsychotic risperidone did not reverse ketamine-induced deteriorations. These findings do not support the cognitive enhancing potential of risperidone on oculomotor biomarkers in this model system of schizophrenia and point towards the importance of developing alternative performance-enhancing compounds to optimise pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Ketamine \", \"Placebo\", \"Smooth pursuit saccadic frequency\", \"significantly increased\", \"Ketamine increased saccadic frequency and decreased velocity gain of SPEM (all P\\u003c0.01) but had no significant effects on PS or AS (all P\\u2a7e0.07).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Dietary fat intake is of particular interest due to strong associations with pathophysiology. In epidemiological trials phospholipid fatty acid composition may reflect composition of habitual diet, although strong correlations have been identified only for essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Preliminary evidence shows that saturated fatty acids (SFA) C15:0 and C17:0 may be acceptable biomarkers. This study measured changes in erythrocyte membrane fatty acids during a period of strictly controlled fat feeding to investigate their use as a short-term marker of compliance, particularly for intake of SFAs.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: This was a randomised cross-over trial in which diet was provided and strictly controlled. 20 healthy, male subjects were given a 40 energy % (en%) fat diet, high in saturated (high-SFA, 20 en%) or unsaturated (high-USFA, 24 en%) fatty acids for 2 periods of 3 weeks. Subjects were residential during intervention with all food and beverages provided. Dietary composition was verified by direct chemical analysis. Blood samples were collected on days 1,7,14, 21 and analysed for red blood cell (RBC) membrane fatty acid composition. Pearson correlation showed RBC fatty acid composition to mimic dietary composition by 3 weeks, but the relationships were weak. Of the SFAs only RBC C16:0 decreased in response to decreased dietary content on high-USFA treatment (ANOVA, diet, P < 0.05). Of the USFAs, higher levels of C18:1 MUFA, C20:4 and C22:6 long chain PUFA on high-USFA diet lead to higher C18:1, C20:4 and C22:6 within RBCs (ANOVA, time*diet, P < 0.05). Pearson's correlation was significant between dietary and RBC fatty acids during the 21d dietary manipulation for C18:1, and C20:5, C22:6 only (P < 0.05).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: RBC membrane fatty acids cannot reliably be used as an independent measure of compliance for dietary SFA intake in short-term studies.

We studied the effect of 14 weeks of beta-carotene supplementation (20 mg d-1) on the frequency of micronuclei in sputum in 114 heavy smokers in a double-blind trial. Micronuclei reflect DNA damage in exfoliated cells and may thus provide a marker of early-stage carcinogenesis. Pre-treatment blood levels of cotinine, beta-carotene, retinol and vitamins C and E were similar in the placebo group (n = 61) and the treatment group (n = 53). Plasma beta-carotene levels increased 13-fold in the treatment group during intervention. Initial micronuclei counts (per 3,000 cells) were higher in the treatment group than in the placebo group (5.0 vs 4.0, P < 0.05). During intervention, the treatment group showed a 47% decrease, whereas the placebo group showed a non-significant decrease (16%). After adjustment for the initial levels, the treatment group had 27% lower micronuclei counts than the placebo group at the end of the trial (95% CI: 9-41%).

We also tested whether the presence or severity of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms, and levels of proinflammatory cytokines, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and other blood markers, would predict or impact treatment response.\n\nABSTRACT.METHOD:: Seventy-nine participants (10 dropouts) not currently taking psychotropic medications with at least moderate scores on self-report mood measures were randomly allocated to receive either a probiotic preparation (containing Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum) or a matched placebo, in a double-blind trial for 8 weeks. Data were analysed as intent-to-treat.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: No significant difference was found between the probiotic and placebo groups on any psychological outcome measure (Cohen's d range = 0.07–0.16) or any blood-based biomarker. At end-point, 9 (23%) of those in the probiotic group showed a ⩾60% change on the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (responders), compared to 10 (26%) of those in the placebo group (χ12=0.107, p = ns). Baseline vitamin D level was found to moderate treatment effect on several outcome measures. Dry mouth and sleep disruption were reported more frequently in the placebo group.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:: This study found no evidence that the probiotic formulation is effective in treating low mood, or in moderating the levels of inflammatory and other biomarkers. The lack of observed effect on mood symptoms may be due to the severity, chronicity or treatment resistance of the sample; recruiting an antidepressant-naive sample experiencing mild, acute symptoms of low mood, may well yield a different result. Future studies taking a preventative approach or using probiotics as an adjuvant treatment may also be more effective. Vitamin D levels should be monitored in future studies in the area.

A feasibility and acceptability study was designed for a residential aged care (RAC) facility, based on the Gold Coast, Australia. Thirty-seven adults, mean age 86.8 ± 6.1 years (30 females) living in a RAC facility. Participants were allocated into an exercise (n = 20) or control (n = 17) group. The exercise group, the Group Aged Care Exercise (GrACE) programme, performed 12 weeks of twice weekly resistance exercises. Feasibility was measured via recruitment rate, measurement (physiological and surveys) completion rate, loss-to-follow-up, exercise session adherence, adverse events, and ratings of burden and acceptability. Muscle function was assessed using gait speed, sit-to-stand and handgrip strength assessments. All intervention participants completed pre- and post-assessments, and the exercise intervention, with 85% (n = 17) of the group attending ≥ 18 of the 24 sessions and 15% (n = 3) attending all sessions.

However, they may, in turn, also influence behavioral adherence and success in weight loss. The present study examined associations among obesity treatment-related variables, i.e., change in weight, quality of life, body image, and subjective well-being, exploring their role as both mediators and outcomes, during a behavioral obesity treatment.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Participants (BMI = 31.1 ± 4.1 kg/m2; age = 38.4 ± 6.7 y) were 144 women who attended a 12-month obesity treatment program and a comparison group (n = 49), who received a general health education program. The intervention included regular group meetings promoting lasting behavior changes in physical activity and dietary intake. Body image, quality of life, subjective well-being, and body weight were measured at baseline and treatment's end. Mediation was tested by multiple regression and a resampling approach to measure indirect effects. Treatment group assignment was the independent variable while changes in weight and in psychosocial variables were analyzed alternatively as mediators and as dependent variables.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: At 12 months, the intervention group had greater weight loss (-5.6 ± 6.8% vs. -1.2 ± 4.6%, p < .001) and larger decreases in body size dissatisfaction (effect size of 1.08 vs. .41, p < .001) than the comparison group. Significant improvements were observed in both groups for all other psychosocial variables (effect sizes ranging from .31–.75, p < .05). Mediation analysis showed that changes in body image and body weight were concurrently mediators and outcomes of treatment, suggesting reciprocal influences. Weight loss partially mediated the effect of treatment on quality of life and on self-esteem but the reciprocal effect was not observed.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Changes in weight and body image may reciprocally affect each other during the course of behavioral obesity treatment. No evidence of reciprocal relationships was found for the other models under analysis; however, weight changes partially explained the effects of treatment on quality of life and self-esteem. Weight and psychosocial changes co-occur during treatment and will probably influence each other dynamically, in ways not yet adequately understood.

A feasibility and acceptability study was designed for a residential aged care (RAC) facility, based on the Gold Coast, Australia. Thirty-seven adults, mean age 86.8 ± 6.1 years (30 females) living in a RAC facility. Participants were allocated into an exercise (n = 20) or control (n = 17) group. The exercise group, the Group Aged Care Exercise (GrACE) programme, performed 12 weeks of twice weekly resistance exercises. Feasibility was measured via recruitment rate, measurement (physiological and surveys) completion rate, loss-to-follow-up, exercise session adherence, adverse events, and ratings of burden and acceptability. Muscle function was assessed using gait speed, sit-to-stand and handgrip strength assessments. All intervention participants completed pre- and post-assessments, and the exercise intervention, with 85% (n = 17) of the group attending ≥ 18 of the 24 sessions and 15% (n = 3) attending all sessions. Acceptability was 100% with exercise participants, and staff who had been involved with the programme strongly agreed that the participants \"Benefited from the programme.\" There were no adverse events reported by any participants during the exercise sessions. When compared to the control group, the exercise group experienced significant improvements in gait speed (F(4.078) = 8.265, p = 0.007), sit to stand performance (F(3.24) = 11.033, p = 0.002) and handgrip strength (F(3.697) = 26.359, p < 0.001).

The efficacy and safety of oral bisphosphonates for the treatment of osteoporosis are well established. However, patient adherence and persistence on treatment are suboptimal. This randomised open-label multi-centre study of 6-months' duration compared persistence on treatment in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis receiving either once-monthly ibandronate plus a patient support programme (PSP), or once-weekly alendronate. To avoid falsely elevated persistence rates often associated with clinical trials, the study was designed to reflect everyday clinical practice in the UK and follow-up visits were limited to be consistent with the primary care setting. Analysis of the primary endpoint showed that persistence was significantly higher in the ibandronate/PSP group compared with the alendronate group (p < 0.0001). The estimated proportion of patients persisting with treatment at 6 months was 56.6% (306/541) and 38.6% (198/513) in the ibandronate/PSP and alendronate groups, respectively. Therefore, compared with alendronate, there was a 47% relative improvement in the proportion of patients persisting with treatment in the ibandronate/PSP group. Secondary endpoint measurements of adherence (e.g. proportion of patients remaining on treatment at study end; proportion of patients discontinuing from the study) were also significantly different in favour of ibandronate plus patient support. In summary, the PERSIST study demonstrated that persistence on treatment was increased in patients receiving once-monthly ibandronate plus patient support compared with once-weekly alendronate.

In this retrospective pooled analysis of these studies we assessed whether the zofenopril effect is influenced by gender.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: the four double-blind, randomized, parallel-group SMILE studies, compared the efficacy and safety of 6–48 week treatment with zofenopril 60 mg/day with that of placebo, lisinopril 10 mg/day or ramipril 10 mg/day in 3630 AMI patients. This pooled analysis compared treatment efficacy (1-year combined occurrence of death or hospitalization for CV causes) in 2733 men and 897 women.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: women were older than men, had a higher prevalence of diabetes and of other major CV risk factors. The risk of a major CV event was significantly larger for women (23% vs. 17% men, p<0.001). Between-gender risk difference was more marked for people living in Southern (+54%) than in Northern Europe (+12%). In both genders zofenopril similarly reduced the 1-year risk of CV morbidity and mortality vs. placebo (−39% men, p = 0.0001; −40% women, p = 0.005). The risk reduction was more marked with zofenopril than with the other ACEIs, particularly in men (−27%, p = 0.012; women: −14%, p = 0.479). The drug safety profile was similar between genders in zofenopril-treated patients, while it was worse in women treated with other ACEIs.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: post-AMI women are at higher risk of CV complications than men, particularly when living in Mediterranean countries. Their response to ACE-inhibition varies according to the type of drug and is usually better in men.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"zofenopril 60 mg/day\", \"placebo\", \"risk of 1-year CV morbidity and mortality \", \"significantly decreased\", \"In both genders zofenopril similarly reduced the 1-year risk of CV morbidity and mortality vs. placebo (\\u221239% men, p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0001; \\u221240% women, p\\u200a=\\u200a0.005).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

This may be caused by increased oxidative stress. Vitamin C is an aqueous phase antioxidant vitamin and free radical scavenger. We hypothesised that if the impairment of endothelial function related to experimental hyperhomocysteinaemia was free radically mediated then co-administration of vitamin C should prevent this.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Ten healthy adults took part in this crossover study. Endothelial function was determined by measuring forearm blood flow (FBF) in response to intra-arterial infusion of acetylcholine (endothelial-dependent) and sodium nitroprusside (endothelial-independent). Subjects received methionine (100 mg/Kg) plus placebo tablets, methionine plus vitamin C (2 g orally) or placebo drink plus placebo tablets. Study drugs were administered at 9 am on each study date, a minimum of two weeks passed between each study. Homocysteine (tHcy) concentration was determined at baseline and after 4 hours. Endothelial function was determined at 4 hours. Responses to the vasoactive substances are expressed as the area under the curve of change in FBF from baseline. Data are mean plus 95% Confidence Intervals.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Following oral methionine tHcy concentration increased significantly versus placebo.

The median PSA was 17 μg/l. Treatments included radical prostatectomy (RP; n = 54; 11%), radiotherapy (RT; n = 245; 50%), androgen deprivation therapy (ADT; n = 122; 25%), other treatments (n = 11; 2%), and unknown (n = 60; 12%). There were 49 PCa-specific deaths (10%), of whom 14 men had received radical treatment (5%); and 129 all-cause deaths (26%). In matched ProtecT and ACN cohorts, 37 (9%) and 64 (16%), respectively, died of PCa, while 89 (22%) and 103 (26%) died of all causes. ProtecT men had a 45% lower risk of death from PCa compared to matched cases (hazard ratio 0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.38–0.83; p = 0.0037), but mortality was similar in those treated radically. The nonrandomised design is a limitation.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Men with PSA-detected advanced PCa excluded from ProtecT and treated radically had low rates of PCa death at 7.4-yr follow-up. Among men who underwent nonradical treatment, the ProtecT group had a lower rate of PCa death. Early detection through PSA testing, leadtime bias, and group heterogeneity are possible factors in this finding.\n\nABSTRACT.PATIENT SUMMARY: Prostate cancer that has spread outside the prostate gland without causing symptoms can be detected via prostate-specific antigen testing and treated, leading to low rates of death from this disease.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"ProtecT trial patients\", \"Patients excluded from the ProtecT\", \"Risk of death from PCa\", \"significantly decreased\", \"ProtecT men had a 45% lower risk of death from PCa compared to matched cases (hazard ratio 0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.38\\u20130.83; p = 0.0037),\"], [\"ProtecT trial patients\", \"Patients excluded from the ProtecT\", \"Mortality rates\", \"no significant difference\", \"ProtecT men had a 45% lower risk of death from PCa compared to matched cases (hazard ratio 0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.38\\u20130.83; p = 0.0037), but mortality was similar in those treated radically.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

This may be caused by increased oxidative stress. Vitamin C is an aqueous phase antioxidant vitamin and free radical scavenger. We hypothesised that if the impairment of endothelial function related to experimental hyperhomocysteinaemia was free radically mediated then co-administration of vitamin C should prevent this.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Ten healthy adults took part in this crossover study. Endothelial function was determined by measuring forearm blood flow (FBF) in response to intra-arterial infusion of acetylcholine (endothelial-dependent) and sodium nitroprusside (endothelial-independent). Subjects received methionine (100 mg/Kg) plus placebo tablets, methionine plus vitamin C (2 g orally) or placebo drink plus placebo tablets. Study drugs were administered at 9 am on each study date, a minimum of two weeks passed between each study. Homocysteine (tHcy) concentration was determined at baseline and after 4 hours. Endothelial function was determined at 4 hours. Responses to the vasoactive substances are expressed as the area under the curve of change in FBF from baseline. Data are mean plus 95% Confidence Intervals.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Following oral methionine tHcy concentration increased significantly versus placebo. At this time endothelial-dependent responses were significantly reduced compared to placebo (31.2 units [22.1-40.3] vs. 46.4 units [42.0-50.8], p < 0.05 vs. Placebo). Endothelial-independent responses were unchanged. Co-administration of vitamin C did not alter the increase in homocysteine or prevent the impairment of endothelial-dependent responses (31.4 [19.5-43.3] vs. 46.4 units [42.0-50.8], p < 0.05 vs. Placebo)\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that methionine increased tHcy with impairment of the endothelial-dependent vasomotor responses.

Eligible patients were chronic NSAID users who demonstrated a clinical worsening of arthritis upon withdrawal of prestudy NSAIDs. Patients received either placebo, etoricoxib 90 mg once daily, or naproxen 500 mg twice daily (2:2:1 allocation ratio). Primary efficacy measures included direct assessment of arthritis by counts of tender and swollen joints, and patient and investigator global assessments of disease activity. Key secondary measures included the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire, patient global assessment of pain, and the percentage of patients who achieved ACR20 responder criteria response (a composite of pain, inflammation, function, and global assessments). Tolerability was assessed by adverse events and routine laboratory evaluations.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: 1171 patients were screened, 891 patients were randomized (N = 357 for placebo, N = 353 for etoricoxib, and N = 181 for naproxen), and 687 completed 12 weeks of treatment (N = 242 for placebo, N = 294 for etoricoxib, and N = 151 for naproxen). Compared with patients receiving placebo, patients receiving etoricoxib and naproxen showed significant improvements in all efficacy endpoints (p<0.05). Treatment responses were similar between the etoricoxib and naproxen groups for all endpoints.

We aimed to investigate if intake of orange juice with or in-between meals differently affects energy balance or metabolic risk. Twenty-six healthy adults (24.7 ± 3.2 y; BMI 23.2 ± 3.2 kg/m2) participated in a 4-week cross-over intervention and consumed orange juice (20% of energy requirement) either together with 3 meals/d (WM) or in-between 3 meals/d (BM) at ad libitum energy intake. Basal and postprandial insulin sensitivity (primary outcome), daylong glycaemia, glucose variability and insulin secretion were assessed. Body fat mass was measured by air-displacement plethysmography. After BM-intervention, fat mass increased (+1.0 ± 1.8 kg; p < 0.05) and postprandial insulin sensitivity tended to decrease (ΔMatsudaISI: −0.89 ± 2.3; p = 0.06). By contrast, after WM-intervention fat mass and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) decreased (−0.30 ± 0.65 kg; −2.50 ± 3.94; both p < 0.05), whereas glucose variability was higher (ΔMAGE: +0.45 ± 0.59, p < 0.05). Daylong glycaemia, insulin secretion, changes in basal insulin sensitivity, and triglycerides did not differ between WM- and BM-interventions (all p > 0.05). In young healthy adults, a conventional 3-meal structure with orange juice consumed together with meals had a favorable impact on energy balance, whereas juice consumption in-between meals may contribute to a gain in body fat and adverse metabolic effects.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Orange juice intake in-between meals (BM)\", \"Orange juice intake with each meal (WM) \", \"Insulin sensitivity after meals\", \"no significant difference\", \"fter BM-intervention, fat mass increased (+1.0 \\u00b1 1.8 kg; p \\u003c 0.05) and postprandial insulin sensitivity tended to decrease (\\u0394MatsudaISI: \\u22120.89 \\u00b1 2.3; p = 0.06). \"], [\"Orange juice intake in-between meals (BM)\", \"Orange juice intake with each meal (WM) \", \"Insulin sensitivity after meals\", \"no significant difference\", \"aylong glycaemia, insulin secretion, changes in basal insulin sensitivity, and triglycerides did not differ between WM- and BM-interventions (all p \\u003e 0.05). \"], [\"Orange juice intake in-between meals (BM)\", \"Orange juice intake with each meal (WM) \", \"Basal insulin sensitivity\", \"no significant difference\", \"Daylong glycaemia, insulin secretion, changes in basal insulin sensitivity, and triglycerides did not differ between WM- and BM-interventions (all p \\u003e 0.05).\"], [\"Orange juice intake in-between meals (BM)\", \"Orange juice intake with each meal (WM) \", \"Secretion of insulin\", \"no significant difference\", \"Daylong glycaemia, insulin secretion, changes in basal insulin sensitivity, and triglycerides did not differ between WM- and BM-interventions (all p \\u003e 0.05).\"], [\"Orange juice intake in-between meals (BM)\", \"Orange juice intake with each meal (WM) \", \"Triglycerides levels\", \"no significant difference\", \"Daylong glycaemia, insulin secretion, changes in basal insulin sensitivity, and triglycerides did not differ between WM- and BM-interventions (all p \\u003e 0.05).\"], [\"Orange juice intake in-between meals (BM)\", \"Orange juice intake with each meal (WM) \", \"Daylong glycemia\", \"no significant difference\", \"Daylong glycaemia, insulin secretion, changes in basal insulin sensitivity, and triglycerides did not differ between WM- and BM-interventions (all p \\u003e 0.05).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

We assessed esomeprazole for maintaining long-term relief of such symptoms. Six hundred and ten patients with a chronic condition requiring anti-inflammatory therapy who achieved relief of NSAID-associated symptoms of pain, discomfort, or burning in the upper abdomen during two previous studies were enrolled and randomly assigned into two identical, multicentre, parallel-group, placebo-controlled studies of esomeprazole 20 mg or 40 mg treatment (NASA2 [Nexium Anti-inflammatory Symptom Amelioration] and SPACE2 [Symptom Prevention by Acid Control with Esomeprazole] studies; ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT00241514 and NCT00241553, respectively) performed at various rheumatology, gastroenterology, and primary care clinics. Four hundred and twenty-six patients completed the 6-month treatment period. The primary measure was the proportion of patients with relapse of upper GI symptoms, recorded in daily diary cards, after 6 months. Relapse was defined as moderate-to-severe upper GI symptoms (a score of more than or equal to 3 on a 7-grade scale) for 3 days or more in any 7-day period. Esomeprazole was significantly more effective than placebo in maintaining relief of upper GI symptoms throughout 6 months of treatment. Life-table estimates (95% confidence intervals) of the proportion of patients with relapse at 6 months (pooled population) were placebo, 39.1% (32.2% to 46.0%); esomeprazole 20 mg, 29.3% (22.3% to 36.2%) (p = 0.006 versus placebo); and esomeprazole 40 mg, 26.1% (19.4% to 32.9%) (p = 0.001 versus placebo). Patients on either non-selective NSAIDs or selective COX-2 inhibitors appeared to benefit. The frequency of adverse events was similar in the three groups. Esomeprazole maintains relief of NSAID-associated upper GI symptoms in patients taking continuous NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"esomeprazole 20 mg or 40 mg treatment\", \"placebo\", \"relief of upper GI symptoms\", \"significantly increased\", \"Esomeprazole was significantly more effective than placebo in maintaining relief of upper GI symptoms throughout 6 months of treatment.\"], [\"esomeprazole 20 mg or 40 mg treatment\", \"placebo\", \"relapse of upper GI symptoms\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Life-table estimates (95% confidence intervals) of the proportion of patients with relapse at 6 months (pooled population) were placebo, 39.1% (32.2% to 46.0%); esomeprazole 20 mg, 29.3% (22.3% to 36.2%) (p = 0.006 versus placebo); and esomeprazole 40 mg, 26.1% (19.4% to 32.9%) (p = 0.001 versus placebo).\"], [\"esomeprazole 20 mg or 40 mg treatment\", \"placebo\", \"relapse of upper GI symptoms\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Relapse was defined as moderate-to-severe upper GI symptoms (a score of more than or equal to 3 on a 7-grade scale) for 3 days or more in any 7-day period.

Each fat had melting characteristics, plasticity and solids fat content suitable for use as hardstock in margarine and other solid fat formulations.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Thirty human volunteers were fed complete, whole food diets during 4 wk periods, where total fat (~31% daily energy, >70% from the test fats) and fatty acid composition were tightly controlled. A crossover design was used with 3 randomly-assigned diet rotations and repeated-measures analysis. One test fat rotation was based on palm olein (POL) and provided 12.0 percent of energy (%en) as palmitic acid (16:0); a second contained trans-rich partially hydrogenated soybean oil (PHSO) and provided 3.2 %en as trans fatty acids plus 6.5 %en as 16:0, while the third used an interesterified fat (IE) and provided 12.5 %en as stearic acid (18:0). After 4 wk the plasma lipoproteins, fatty acid profile, as well as fasting glucose and insulin were assessed. In addition, after 2 wk into each period an 8 h postprandial challenge was initiated in a subset of 19 subjects who consumed a meal containing 53 g of test fat.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: After 4 wk, both PHSO and IE fats significantly elevated both the LDL/HDL ratio and fasting blood glucose, the latter almost 20% in the IE group relative to POL.

Increasing interest in the use of low-dose ketamine for postoperative analgesia has developed in part because of its NMDA-antagonistic properties, which may be important in attenuating central sensitization and opioid tolerance. Despite of many trial evaluations which have been done on the effect of low-dose ketamine in postoperative pain, the role of ketamine, as a component of perioperative analgesia, remains unclear. We evaluated the analgesic effect of low-dose ketamine during anesthesia induction in painful ophthalmic surgery.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:: After institutional approval and written informed consent, 88 patients undergoing retinal detachment, strabismus, and keratoplasty surgery aged 18-80 years old were randomly divided intoequal case and control groups. Anesthesia was induced with sodium thiopental, fentanyl, atracurium, and liducaine, and maintained with N2O, O2, and propofol. Ketamine 0.5 mg/kg was administered intravenously to patients in the case group during anesthetic induction. Mean blood pressure and pulse rate were listed in questionnaire every 5 minutes. The consumption of anesthetic, perioperative additional analgesic, extubation time, postoperative pain and nausea scores (based on Visual Analog Scale), vomiting frequency, and the recovery time were recorded.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: There were no differences in the recovery time (17.3 ± 3.4 in the case group vs. 16.3 ± 3 in the control group, P < 0.05), postoperative pain scores (5 ± 1 in the case group vs. 5.6 ± 2 in the control group, P < 0.05), the consumption of anesthetic (9376.9 ± 1245.8 in the case group vs. 9012.9 ± 1620 in the control group, P < 0.05), the analgesic requirements (1000 in the case group vs. 940.9 ± 135.6 in the control group, P < 0.05), and perioperative additional analgesic (63.4 ± 26.5 in the case group vs. 69.4 ± 25.6 in the control group, P < 0.05) between two groups. The extubation time in the case group (13.59 ± 4.83) was significantly shorter than in the control group (15.9 ± 3.6) (P = 0.01).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: This study demonstrates that a low dose administration of ketamine during anesthesia induction in retinal detachment, strabismus, and keratoplasty surgery improves the extubation time but have no effect on postoperative pain, nausea and vomiting, and perioperative additional analgesic requirements.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Ketamine\", \"Control\", \"Recovery time\", \"no significant difference\", \"There were no differences in the recovery time (17.3 \\u00b1 3.4 in the case group vs. 16.3 \\u00b1 3 in the control group, P \\u003c 0.05),\"], [\"Ketamine\", \"Control\", \"Post-Surgical Pain\", \"no significant difference\", \"There were no differences in the recovery time (17.3 \\u00b1 3.4 in the case group vs. 16.3 \\u00b1 3 in the control group, P \\u003c 0.05), postoperative pain scores (5 \\u00b1 1 in the case group vs. 5.6 \\u00b1 2 in the control group, P \\u003c 0.05),\"], [\"Ketamine\", \"Control\", \"Anesthetic usage\", \"no significant difference\", \"There were no differences in the recovery time (17.3 \\u00b1 3.4 in the case group vs. 16.3 \\u00b1 3 in the control group, P \\u003c 0.05), postoperative pain scores (5 \\u00b1 1 in the case group vs. 5.6 \\u00b1 2 in the control group, P \\u003c 0.05), the consumption of anesthetic (9376.9 \\u00b1 1245.8 in the case group vs. 9012.9 \\u00b1 1620 in the control group, P \\u003c 0.05),\"], [\"Ketamine\", \"Control\", \"Usage of analgesics\", \"no significant difference\", \"the analgesic requirements (1000 in the case group vs. 940.9 \\u00b1 135.6 in the control group\"], [\"Ketamine\", \"Control\", \"Time for extubation \", \"significantly decreased\", \"The extubation time in the case group (13.59 \\u00b1 4.83) was significantly shorter than in the control group (15.9 \\u00b1 3.6) (P = 0.01).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Each fat had melting characteristics, plasticity and solids fat content suitable for use as hardstock in margarine and other solid fat formulations.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Thirty human volunteers were fed complete, whole food diets during 4 wk periods, where total fat (~31% daily energy, >70% from the test fats) and fatty acid composition were tightly controlled. A crossover design was used with 3 randomly-assigned diet rotations and repeated-measures analysis. One test fat rotation was based on palm olein (POL) and provided 12.0 percent of energy (%en) as palmitic acid (16:0); a second contained trans-rich partially hydrogenated soybean oil (PHSO) and provided 3.2 %en as trans fatty acids plus 6.5 %en as 16:0, while the third used an interesterified fat (IE) and provided 12.5 %en as stearic acid (18:0). After 4 wk the plasma lipoproteins, fatty acid profile, as well as fasting glucose and insulin were assessed. In addition, after 2 wk into each period an 8 h postprandial challenge was initiated in a subset of 19 subjects who consumed a meal containing 53 g of test fat.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: After 4 wk, both PHSO and IE fats significantly elevated both the LDL/HDL ratio and fasting blood glucose, the latter almost 20% in the IE group relative to POL. Fasting 4 wk insulin was 10% lower after PHSO (p > 0.05) and 22% lower after IE (p < 0.001) compared to POL. For the postprandial study the glucose incremental area under the curve (IAUC) following the IE meal was 40% greater than after either other meal (p < 0.001), and was linked to relatively depressed insulin and C-peptide (p < 0.05).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Both PHSO and IE fats altered the metabolism of lipoproteins and glucose relative to an unmodified saturated fat when fed to humans under identical circumstances.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"Palm olein\", \"Unmodified saturated fat\", \"LDL/HDL ratio\", \"no significant difference\", \"both PHSO and IE fats significantly elevated both the LDL/HDL ratio and fasting blood glucose, the latter almost 20% in the IE group relative to POL.\"],\n    [\"Trans-rich partially hydrogenated soybean oil\", \"Unmodified saturated fat\", \"Fasting blood glucose\", \"significantly increased\", \"both PHSO and IE fats significantly elevated both the LDL/HDL ratio and fasting blood glucose, the latter almost 20% in the IE group relative to POL.\"],\n    [\"Interesterified fat\", \"Unmodified saturated fat\", \"Fasting blood glucose\", \"significantly increased\", \"both PHSO and IE fats significantly elevated both the LDL/HDL ratio and fasting blood glucose, the latter almost 20% in the IE group relative to POL.\"],\n    [\"Interesterified fat\", \"Unmodified saturated fat\", \"Fasting insulin\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Fasting 4 wk insulin was 10% lower after PHSO (p > 0.05) and 22% lower after IE (p < 0.001) compared to POL.\"],\n    [\"Interesterified fat\", \"Unmodified saturated fat\", \"Postprandial glucose IAUC\", \"significantly increased\", \"the glucose incremental area under the curve (IAUC) following the IE meal was 40% greater than after either other meal (p < 0.001), and was linked to relatively depressed insulin and C-peptide (p < 0.05).\"],\n    [\"Trans-rich partially hydrogenated soybean oil\", \"Unmodified saturated fat\", \"Fasting insulin\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Fasting 4 wk insulin was 10% lower after PHSO (p > 0.05) and 22% lower after IE (p < 0.001) compared to POL.\"],\n    [\"Palm olein\", \"Unmodified saturated fat\", \"Fasting insulin\", \"no significant difference\", \"Fasting 4 wk insulin was 10% lower after PHSO (p > 0.05) and 22% lower after IE (p < 0.001) compared to POL.\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"Palm olein\", \"Unmodified saturated fat\", \"LDL/HDL ratio\", \"no significant difference\", \"both PHSO and IE fats significantly elevated both the LDL/HDL ratio and fasting blood glucose, the latter almost 20% in the IE group relative to POL.\"],\n    [\"Trans-rich partially hydrogenated soybean oil\", \"Unmodified saturated fat\", \"Fasting blood glucose\", \"significantly increased\", \"both PHSO and IE fats significantly elevated both the LDL/HDL ratio and fasting blood glucose, the latter almost 20% in the IE group relative to POL.\"],\n    [\"Interesterified fat\", \"Unmodified saturated fat\", \"Fasting blood glucose\", \"significantly increased\", \"both PHSO and IE fats significantly elevated both the LDL/HDL ratio and fasting blood glucose, the latter almost 20% in the IE group relative to POL.\"],\n    [\"Interesterified fat\", \"Unmodified saturated fat\", \"Fasting insulin\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Fasting 4 wk insulin was 10% lower after PHSO (p > 0.05) and 22% lower after IE (p < 0.001) compared to POL.\"],\n    [\"Interesterified fat\", \"Unmodified saturated fat\", \"Postprandial glucose IAUC\", \"significantly increased\", \"the glucose incremental area under the curve (IAUC) following the IE meal was 40% greater than after either other meal (p < 0.001), and was linked to relatively depressed insulin and C-peptide (p < 0.05).\"],\n    [\"Trans-rich partially hydrogenated soybean oil\", \"Unmodified saturated fat\", \"Fasting insulin\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Fasting 4 wk insulin was 10% lower after PHSO (p > 0.05) and 22% lower after IE (p < 0.001) compared to POL.\"],\n    [\"Palm olein\", \"Unmodified saturated fat\", \"Fasting insulin\", \"no significant difference\", \"Fasting 4 wk insulin was 10% lower after PHSO (p > 0.05) and 22% lower after IE (p < 0.001) compared to POL.\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "1d191de7cfb96b1d032ad6e9ece337b4fefa1723ed8d5a008169eadf54e05cca", "prompt_hash": "34ee8958cdc38512f0cd996d0baf63b43a4a26d4331d79d5af8bafc74c7255e3", "target_hash": "3ad04a156b0d860fb2144430da092edb31ca9d653ca341fc20e730d4e9214bcd", "bypass": null}

The objective of the Syndromic Surveillance Evaluation Study was to develop and implement standardized supports in local public health agencies in Ontario, Canada, and evaluate the ability of these supports to affect actions taken as part of public health communicable disease control programs.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Local public health agencies (LPHA) in Ontario, which used syndromic surveillance based on emergency department visits for respiratory disease, were recruited and randomly allocated to the study intervention or control group. The intervention group health agencies received standardized supports in terms of a standardized aberrant event detection algorithm and a response protocol dictating steps to investigate and assess the public health significance of syndromic surveillance alerts. The control group continued with their pre-existing syndromic surveillance infrastructure and processes. Outcomes were assessed using logbooks, which collected quantitative and qualitative information about alerts received, investigation steps taken, and public health responses. The study was conducted prospectively for 15 months (October 2013 to February 2015).\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Fifteen LPHAs participated in the study (n = 9 intervention group, n = 6 control group). A total of 1,969 syndromic surveillance alerts were received by all LPHAs. Variations in the types and amount of responses varied by LPHA, in particularly differences were noted by the size of the health unit. Smaller health units had more challenges to both detect and mount a response to any alerts. LPHAs in the control group were more likely to declare alerts to have public health significance and to initiate any action. Regression models using repeated measures showed an interaction between the year (Year 1 versus Year 2) and the intervention as well as an interaction between year and sustained nature of the alert. Both of these were linked to the control health units reporting more \"watchful waiting\".\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: This study raises questions about the effectiveness of using standardized protocols to improve the performance of syndromic surveillance in a decentralized public health system. Despite efforts to create standardized protocols and engage public health agencies in the process, no significant differences in the effective use of syndromic alerts were observed beyond year 1. It also raises questions about the minimum capacity of the agency and minimum population size that are required for an effective response.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Standardized aberrant event detection algorithm and response protocol\", \"Pre-existing syndromic surveillance infrastructure and processes\", \"Effective use of syndromic alerts after 1 year\", \"no significant difference\", \"Despite efforts to create standardized protocols and engage public health agencies in the process, no significant differences in the effective use of syndromic alerts were observed beyond year 1.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Evidence on the effect of non-monetary incentives on response rates in observational longitudinal research is scarce.\n\nABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES: To study the impact of two strategies to enhance completeness and efficiency in observational cohort studies with follow-up durations of around 2 years.\n\nABSTRACT.METHOD AND INTERVENTION: In a factorial design, 771 children between 2 and 5 years old and their parents participating in a prospective cohort study were randomized to three intervention groups and a control group. Three types of lotteries were run: (i) daytrip tickets for the whole family to a popular amusement park if they returned all postal questionnaires, (ii) €12.50-worth gift vouchers for sending back the questionnaire on time after each questionnaire round and (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii).\n\nABSTRACT.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was the proportion of participants who returned all questionnaires without any reminder. Secondary outcomes were '100% returned with or without reminder', 'probability of 100% non-response', 'probability of withdrawal', 'proportion of returned questionnaires' and 'overall number of reminders sent'.\n\nABSTRACT.STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: After testing for interaction between the two lottery interventions, the two trials were analysed separately. We calculated risk differences (RD) and numbers needed to \"treat\" and their 95% confidence intervals.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Daytrip nor voucher intervention had an effect on the proportion of participants who returned all questionnaires (RD −0.01; 95% CI-0.07 – 0.06) and (RD 0.02; 95% CI-0.50 – 0.08), respectively.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the effect of religious programs based on Islam on spiritual wellbeing in elderly patients with hypertension who referred to the health centers of Isfahan in 2014.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:: This study was a randomized clinical trial. The participants (52 elderly patients with hypertension) were randomly divided in to experimental and control groups. Religious program was implemented for the experimental group in eight sessions in two Isfahan health centers. Spirituality wellbeing survey (SWB) questionnaire was completed in three steps, namely, pretest, posttest and follow-up (1 month) in two groups. In the study, Chi-square test, independent t-test, and repeated-measures analysis of variance were performed for analyzing the data.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: Before the intervention, there was no significant difference between the mean scores of spiritual wellbeing, the religious dimension, and the existential aspect of spiritual wellbeing of the two groups. However in the posttest step and follow-up stage, the mean scores of spiritual wellbeing, the religious dimension, and the existential aspect of spiritual wellbeing in the experimental group was significantly higher than in the control group (P < 0.001).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:: The religious program based on Islam promoted the SWB of elderly patients with hypertension; further, nurses can use these programs to promote the SWB of elderly patients with hypertension.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Religious programs\", \"Control \", \"Religious dimension improvement right after test \", \"significantly increased\", \"However in the posttest step and follow-up stage, the mean scores of spiritual wellbeing, the religious dimension, and the existential aspect of spiritual wellbeing in the experimental group was significantly higher than in the control group (P \\u003c 0.001).\"], [\"Religious programs\", \"Control \", \"Religious dimension improvement 1 month after test \", \"significantly increased\", \"However in the posttest step and follow-up stage, the mean scores of spiritual wellbeing, the religious dimension, and the existential aspect of spiritual wellbeing in the experimental group was significantly higher than in the control group (P \\u003c 0.001).\"], [\"Religious programs\", \"Control \", \"Spiritual existential aspect 1 month after test \", \"significantly increased\", \".

Evidence on the effect of non-monetary incentives on response rates in observational longitudinal research is scarce.\n\nABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES: To study the impact of two strategies to enhance completeness and efficiency in observational cohort studies with follow-up durations of around 2 years.\n\nABSTRACT.METHOD AND INTERVENTION: In a factorial design, 771 children between 2 and 5 years old and their parents participating in a prospective cohort study were randomized to three intervention groups and a control group. Three types of lotteries were run: (i) daytrip tickets for the whole family to a popular amusement park if they returned all postal questionnaires, (ii) €12.50-worth gift vouchers for sending back the questionnaire on time after each questionnaire round and (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii).\n\nABSTRACT.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was the proportion of participants who returned all questionnaires without any reminder. Secondary outcomes were '100% returned with or without reminder', 'probability of 100% non-response', 'probability of withdrawal', 'proportion of returned questionnaires' and 'overall number of reminders sent'.\n\nABSTRACT.STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: After testing for interaction between the two lottery interventions, the two trials were analysed separately. We calculated risk differences (RD) and numbers needed to \"treat\" and their 95% confidence intervals.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Daytrip nor voucher intervention had an effect on the proportion of participants who returned all questionnaires (RD −0.01; 95% CI-0.07 – 0.06) and (RD 0.02; 95% CI-0.50 – 0.08), respectively. No effects were found on the secondary outcomes.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Our findings do not support the idea that lottery-style incentives lead to more complete response to postal questionnaires in observational cohort studies with repeated data collection and follow-up durations of around 2 years.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[[\"lottery-style incentives\", \"control\", \"proportion of participants who returned all questionnaires\", \"no significant difference\", \"Daytrip nor voucher intervention had an effect on the proportion of participants who returned all questionnaires (RD −0.01; 95% CI-0.07 – 0.06) and (RD 0.02; 95% CI-0.50 – 0.08), respectively.

Branded drug websites often capitalize on the multimedia capabilities of the Internet by using videos to emphasize drug benefits and characteristics. However, it is unknown how such videos affect consumer processing of drug information.\n\nABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine how videos on prescription drug websites, and the inclusion of risk information in those videos, influence consumer knowledge and perceptions.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: We conducted an experimental study in which online panel participants with acid reflux (n=1070) or high blood pressure (n=1055) were randomly assigned to view 1 of the 10 fictitious prescription drug websites and complete a short questionnaire. On each website, we manipulated the type of video (patient testimonial, mechanism of action animation, or none) and whether the video mentioned drug risks.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Participants who viewed any video were less likely to recognize drug risks presented only in the website text (P≤.01). Including risk information in videos increased participants' recognition of the risks presented in the videos (P≤.01). However, in some cases, including risk information in videos decreased participants' recognition of the risks not presented in the videos (ie, risks presented in text only; P≤.04). Participants who viewed a video without drug risk information thought that the website placed more emphasis on benefits, compared with participants who viewed the video with drug risk information (P≤.01). Compared with participants who viewed a video without drug risk information, participants who viewed a video with drug risk information thought that the drug was less effective in the high blood pressure sample (P=.03) and thought that risks were more serious in the acid reflux sample (P=.01). There were no significant differences between risk and nonrisk video conditions on other perception measures (P>.05).

To assess the impact of brief smoking on the vasculature, we determined levels of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and circulating microparticles (MPs) following the smoking of one cigarette by young, healthy intermittent smokers.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS: 12 healthy volunteers were randomized to either smoking or not smoking in a crossover fashion. Blood sampling was performed at baseline, 1, 4 and 24 hours following smoking/not smoking. The numbers of EPCs and MPs were determined by flow cytometry. MPs were measured from platelets, leukocytes and endothelial cells. Moreover, MPs were also labelled with anti-HMGB1 and SYTO 13 to assess the content of nuclear molecules.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Active smoking of one cigarette caused an immediate and significant increase in the numbers of circulating EPCs and MPs of platelet-, endothelial- and leukocyte origin. Levels of MPs containing nuclear molecules were increased, of which the majority were positive for CD41 and CD45 (platelet- and leukocyte origin). CD144 (VE-cadherin) or HMGB1 release did not significantly change during active smoking.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Brief active smoking of one cigarette generated an acute release of EPC and MPs, of which the latter contained nuclear matter. Together, these results demonstrate acute effects of cigarette smoke on endothelial, platelet and leukocyte function as well as injury to the vascular wall.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Smoking group\", \"Control\", \"Lactadherin+ CD144+\", \"no significant difference\", \"CD144 (VE-cadherin) or HMGB1 release did not significantly change during active smoking\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Seventy-five HIV-1 infected patients matched for gender, age, and renal function made up the control. All subjects completed follow-up visits over 48 weeks. CD4 cell count, plasma HIV-1 viral load, and urine protein level were assessed at the trial start (baseline, week 0) and at week 48. The serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were monitored at each follow-up point. Change in eGFR from baseline to week 48 was also compared.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Compared to control, the TDF+PI/r group exhibited higher levels of serum creatinine (79 vs. 69.7 μmol/L, P<0.001) and a lower rate of eGFR (93.0 vs. 101.6 ml/min/1.73m2, P=0.009) at the end of week 48. Patients treated with TDF+PI/r showed greater decline in eGFR than control (−8.8 vs. 6.4ml/min/1.73m2, P<0.001). Compared to baseline renal function of the control group, the TDF+PI/r group exhibited a greater median decline in eGFR at the end of week 48 (P<0.001).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: We found that a TDF+PI/r based ART regimen resulted in greater renal function decline over 48 weeks.

Japanese patients who met the criteria were randomized to trial group and the combination diuretic group (received 7.5 mg of tolvaptan) or the conventional diuretic group (received 40 mg of furosemide) for 7 d in addition to the natriuretic drug which was used prior to enrolment in this study. The primary endpoint was the change in body weight from the baseline. Vital signs, fluid intake, and laboratory and urinary data were assessed to determine the pharmacological effects after administration of aquaretic and natriuretic drugs.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: A total of 56 patients were randomized to receive either tolvaptan (n = 28) or furosemide (n = 28). In the combination and conventional diuretic groups, the average decrease in body weight from the baseline was 3.21 ± 3.17 kg (P < 0.0001) and 1.75 ± 2.36 kg (P = 0.0006), respectively, when measured on the final dosing day. Following 1 wk of treatment, a significantly greater reduction in body weight was observed in the combination diuretic group compared to that in the conventional diuretic group (P = 0.0412).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Compared to a conventional diuretic therapy with only a natriuretic drug, a combination diuretic therapy with natriuretic and aquaretic drugs is more effective for patients with cirrhotic ascites.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"combination  diuretic group (received 7.5 mg of tolvaptan)\", \"conventional diuretic group (received 40 mg of furosemide)\", \"body weight\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Following 1 wk of treatment, a significantly greater reduction in body weight was observed in the combination diuretic group compared to that in the conventional diuretic group (P = 0.0412).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Seventy-five HIV-1 infected patients matched for gender, age, and renal function made up the control. All subjects completed follow-up visits over 48 weeks. CD4 cell count, plasma HIV-1 viral load, and urine protein level were assessed at the trial start (baseline, week 0) and at week 48. The serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were monitored at each follow-up point. Change in eGFR from baseline to week 48 was also compared.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Compared to control, the TDF+PI/r group exhibited higher levels of serum creatinine (79 vs. 69.7 μmol/L, P<0.001) and a lower rate of eGFR (93.0 vs. 101.6 ml/min/1.73m2, P=0.009) at the end of week 48. Patients treated with TDF+PI/r showed greater decline in eGFR than control (−8.8 vs. 6.4ml/min/1.73m2, P<0.001). Compared to baseline renal function of the control group, the TDF+PI/r group exhibited a greater median decline in eGFR at the end of week 48 (P<0.001).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: We found that a TDF+PI/r based ART regimen resulted in greater renal function decline over 48 weeks. Therefore, renal function should be monitored especially when TDF is used in combination with PI/r.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00872417\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[[\"tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) plus ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI/r) regimen\", \"control\", \"estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Compared to control, the TDF+PI/r group exhibited lower rate of eGFR (93.0 vs. 101.6 ml/min/1.73m2, P=0.009) at the end of week 48.

The primary outcome was baseline-to-endpoint change in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score. Secondary outcome measures included the Clinical Global Impressions-Bipolar Version Severity of Illness Scale (CGI-BP), the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) total score, the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score, and rates of response (≥50% baseline-to-endpoint reduction in MADRS total score), recovery, and remission.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Of the 156 Japanese patients, 104 had been allocated to olanzapine and 52 to placebo. All results are baseline-to-endpoint change. Compared to placebo, patients in the olanzapine group experienced greater improvement in the primary outcome measure, MADRS total score (−14.9 vs. −10.7; p = .01). They also had greater reductions in the following secondary measures: CGI- BP Depression (−1.41 vs. -0.89; p = .008), CGI-BP Bipolar (−1.31 vs. −0.83; p = .01), HAMD-17 (−11.7 vs. −7.9; p < .01), and YMRS (-0.32 vs. 0.34; p = .03). Differences in rates of response, recovery, and remission were not statistically significant. A greater proportion of olanzapine-treated patients reported treatment- emergent adverse events (87.5% vs. 59.6%; p < .001). Patients treated with olanzapine had greater increases in weight (p < .001) and fasting total cholesterol (p = .008); fasting triglycerides (p = .02), and fasting low-density lipoprotein (p = .01). There was a greater reduction in fasting high-density lipoprotein in olanzapine-treated patients (p = .01). Compared with placebo-group patients, more olanzapine-group patients shifted from borderline to high cholesterol (25.0% vs. 0.0%; p = .007) and had clinically significant weight gain (≥7% body weight) (20.2% vs. 1.9%; p = .001).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Results of this analysis support the efficacy and tolerability of olanzapine for the treatment of bipolar depression in Japanese patients. Results in this population were consistent with those seen in the more ethnically diverse parent study. In making treatment decisions for individual patients, clinicians should carefully consider the risks and benefits of olanzapine treatment.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicatrials.gov ID NCT00510146 Olanzapine Treatment of Patients with Bipolar I Disorder\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"olanzapine\", \"placebo\", \"improvement in the primary outcome measure, MADRS total score\", \"significantly increased\", \"Compared to placebo, patients in the olanzapine group experienced greater improvement in the primary outcome measure, MADRS total score (\\u221214.9 vs. \\u221210.7; p\\u2009=\\u2009.01).\"], [\"olanzapine\", \"placebo\", \"reductions in the following secondary measures: CGI- BP Depression\", \"significantly increased\", \"They also had greater reductions in the following secondary measures: CGI- BP Depression (\\u22121.41 vs. -0.89; p\\u2009=\\u2009.008),\"], [\"olanzapine\", \"placebo\", \"rates of response, recovery, and remission\", \"no significant difference\", \"Differences in rates of response, recovery, and remission were not statistically significant.\"], [\"olanzapine\", \"placebo\", \"treatment- emergent adverse events\", \"significantly increased\", \"A greater proportion of olanzapine-treated patients reported treatment- emergent adverse events (87.5% vs. 59.6%; p\\u2009\\u0026lt;\\u2009.001).\"], [\"olanzapine\", \"placebo\", \"treatment- emergent adverse events\", \"significantly increased\", \"A greater proportion of olanzapine-treated patients reported treatment- emergent adverse events (87.5% vs. 59.6%; p\\u2009\\u003c\\u2009.001).

This was followed by an exploratory 21-day study in which TAU participants received OLPs while OLP participants in the main study were followed after discontinuing placebos. Cancer survivors (N = 74) who completed cancer treatment 6 months to 10 years prior to enrollment reporting at least moderate fatigue (i.e., ≥4 on a 0–10 scale) were randomized to OLP or TAU. Those randomized to OLP took 2 placebo pills twice a day for 21 days. Compared to those randomized to TAU, OLP participants reported a 29% improvement in fatigue severity (average difference in the mean change scores (MD) 12.47, 95% CI 3.32, 21.61; P = 0.008), medium effect (d = 0.63), and a 39% improvement in fatigue-disrupted quality of life (MD = 11.76, 95% CI 4.65, 18.86; P = 0.002), a large effect (d = 0.76). TAU participants who elected to try OLP for 21-days after the main study reported reductions in fatigue of a similar magnitude for fatigue severity and fatigue-disrupted quality of life (23% and 35%, respectively).

Its therapeutic approach is challenging as the first line treatment often does not help, or even causes intolerable side effects. The aim of our randomized double blind, placebo controlled, crossover study was to investigate in a prospective way the effect of lidocaine in patients with trigeminal neuralgia. Twenty patients met our inclusion criteria and completed the study. Each patient underwent four weekly sessions, two of which were with lidocaine (5 mgs/kg) and two with placebo infusions administered over 60 minutes. Intravenous lidocaine was superior regarding the reduction of the intensity of pain, the allodynia, and the hyperalgesia compared to placebo. Moreover, contrary to placebo, lidocaine managed to maintain its therapeutic results for the first 24 hours after intravenous infusion. Although, intravenous lidocaine is not a first line treatment, when first line medications fail to help, pain specialists may try it as an add-on treatment. This trial is registered with NCT01955967.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"lidocaine (5 mgs/kg)\", \"placebo\", \"intensity of pain\", \"significantly decreased\", \"ntravenous lidocaine was superior regarding the reduction of the intensity of pain, the allodynia, and the hyperalgesia compared to placebo.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

The aim of this case-controlled study was to investigate if vitamin D supplementation could improve pain management, quality of life (QoL) and decrease infections in palliative cancer patients.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Thirty-nine palliative cancer patients with levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 75 nmol/L were supplemented with vitamin D 4000 IE/day, and were compared to 39 untreated, matched \"control\"-patients from a previous study at the same ward. Opioid doses, antibiotic consumption and QoL-scores measured with the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) were monitored. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline after 1 and 3 months compared between the groups using linear regression with adjustment for a potential cofounding factor.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: After 1 month the vitamin D treated group had a significantly decreased fentanyl dose compared to the untreated group with a difference of 46 μg/h; 95% CI 24–78, which increased further at 3 months to 91 μg/h; 95% CI 56–140 μg/h. The ESAS QoL-score improved in the Vitamin D group the first month; -1.4; 95% CI -2.6 - (-0.21).

Haemodynamic parameters were assessed at baseline and week 16.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Riociguat decreased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in inoperable (n=189; least-squares mean difference: −285 dyn s/cm5 (95% CI −357 to −213); p<0.0001) and persistent/recurrent (n=72; −131 dyn s/cm5 (95% CI −214 to −48); p=0.0025) patients. Cardiac index improved in inoperable patients by a least-squares mean difference of +0.6 L/min/m2 (95% CI 0.4 to 0.7; p<0.0001), while in persistent/recurrent patients the change was +0.2 L/min/m2 (95% CI −0.1 to 0.5; p=0.17). Mean pulmonary artery pressure decreased in inoperable and persistent/recurrent patients(−4.7 mm Hg (95% CI −6.9 to −2.6; p<0.0001 and −4.8 mm Hg (–8.2 to −1.5; p=0.0055), respectively). For all patients, changes in 6 min walk distance correlated with changes in PVR (r=−0.29 (95% CI −0.41 to −0.17); p<0.0001) and cardiac index (r=0.23 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.35); p=0.0004).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Riociguat improved haemodynamics in patients with inoperable CTEPH or persistent/recurrent CTEPH.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00855465.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Riociguat group\", \"Placebo group\", \"Improvement of cardiac index in persistent/recurrent patients\", \"no significant difference\", \"Cardiac index improved in inoperable patients by a least-squares mean difference of +0.6 L/min/m2 (95% CI 0.4 to 0.7; p\\u003c0.0001), while in persistent/recurrent patients the change was +0.2 L/min/m2 (95% CI \\u22120.1 to 0.5; p=0.17).\"], [\"Riociguat group\", \"Placebo group\", \"Pulmonary vascular resistance\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Riociguat decreased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in inoperable (n=189; least-squares mean difference: \\u2212285 dyn s/cm5 (95% CI \\u2212357 to \\u2212213); p\\u003c0.0001) and persistent/recurrent (n=72; \\u2212131 dyn s/cm5 (95% CI \\u2212214 to \\u221248); p=0.0025) patients.\"], [\"Riociguat group\", \"Placebo group\", \"Mean pulmonary artery pressure\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Mean pulmonary artery pressure decreased in inoperable and persistent/recurrent patients(\\u22124.7 mm Hg (95% CI \\u22126.9 to \\u22122.6; p\\u003c0.0001 and \\u22124.8 mm Hg (\\u20138.2 to \\u22121.5; p=0.0055), respectively)\"], [\"Riociguat group\", \"Placebo group\", \"Improvement of cardiac index in inoperable patients\", \"significantly increased\", \"Cardiac index improved in inoperable patients by a least-squares mean difference of +0.6 L/min/m2 (95% CI 0.4 to 0.7; p\\u003c0.0001), while in persistent/recurrent patients the change was +0.2 L/min/m2 (95% CI \\u22120.1 to 0.5; p=0.17).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

It is a soft tissue disorder that causes significant disability and pain. <p> The aim of the study was to establish that an intramuscular steroid injection is effective in the short-term pain relief and functional improvement of tennis elbow. The severity of pain at the injection site was monitored to determine whether the intramuscular injection is better tolerated than the intralesional injection.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS AND RESULTS: 19 patients, who had no treatment for tennis elbow in the preceding 3 months, were recruited from Whipps Cross University Hospital, London, and were randomised to receive either 80 mg of intramuscular Depo-Medrone or 40 mg of intralesional Depo-Medrone injection. Blinding proved difficult as the injection sites differed and placebo arms were not included in the study. A Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) Questionnaire and a 10-point Likert scale were used to assess primary outcome. Six weeks after the treatment, there was a reduction in pain, improvement in function and total PRTEE scores in both intramuscular and intralesional groups (p=0.008) using a 95% CI for mean treatment difference of −26 to +16 points. A statistically significant result (p=0.001) in favour of intramuscular causing less pain at the injection site was noted.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Non-inferiority of intramuscular to intralesional injections was not confirmed; however, the intramuscular injection proved to be effective in reducing tennis elbow-related symptoms and was found less painful at the site of injection at the time of administration.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: EUDRACT Number: 2010-022131-11. <p> REC Number: 10/H0718/76 (NRES, Central London REC 1).\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"80\\u2009mg of intramuscular Depo-Medrone\", \"40\\u2009mg of intralesional Depo-Medrone\", \"pain at the injection site\", \"significantly decreased\", \"A statistically significant result (p=0.001) in favour of intramuscular causing less pain at the injection site was noted.\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:200"}, "target": "[[\"80\\u2009mg of intramuscular Depo-Medrone\", \"40\\u2009mg of intralesional Depo-Medrone\", \"pain at the injection site\", \"significantly decreased\", \"A statistically significant result (p=0.001) in favour of intramuscular causing less pain at the injection site was noted.\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

Delivering brief alcohol interventions to employees as part of a health check may be acceptable, particularly with online delivery which can provide privacy for this stigmatised behaviour. Research to support this approach is limited and methodologically weak. The aim was to determine the effectiveness of online screening and personalised feedback on alcohol consumption, delivered in a workplace as part of a health check.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS AND FINDINGS: This two-group online individually randomised controlled trial recruited employees from a UK-based private sector organisation (approx. 100,000 employees). 3,375 employees completed the online health check in the three week recruitment period. Of these, 1,330 (39%) scored five or more on the AUDIT-C (indicating alcohol misuse) and were randomised to receive personalised feedback on their alcohol intake, alongside feedback on other health behaviours (n = 659), or to receive feedback on all health behaviours except alcohol intake (n = 671). Participants were mostly male (75%), with a median age of 48 years and half were in managerial positions (55%). Median Body Mass Index was 26, 12% were smokers, median time undertaking moderate/vigorous physical activity a week was 173 minutes and median fruit and vegetable consumption was three portions a day. Eighty percent (n = 1,066) of participants completed follow-up questionnaires at three months. An intention to treat analysis found no difference between experimental groups for past week drinking (primary outcome) (5.6% increase associated with the intervention (95% CI −4.7% to 16.9%; p = .30)), AUDIT (measure of alcohol-related harm) and health utility (EQ-5D).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence to support the use of personalised feedback within an online health check for reducing alcohol consumption among employees in this organisation.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of an intraoperative goal-directed fluid restriction (GDFR) strategy on the postoperative outcome of high-risk patients undergoing brain surgery.\n\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: High-risk patients undergoing brain surgery were randomly assigned to a usual care group (control group) or a GDFR group. In the GDFR group, (1) fluid maintenance was restricted to 3 ml/kg/h of a crystalloid solution and (2) colloid boluses were allowed only in case of hypotension associated with a low cardiac index and a high stroke volume variation. The primary outcome variable was ICU length of stay, and secondary outcomes were lactates at the end of surgery, postoperative complications, hospital length of stay, mortality at day 30, and costs.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: A total of 73 patients from the GDFR group were compared with 72 patients from the control group. Before surgery, the two groups were comparable. During surgery, the GDFR group received less colloid (1.9 ± 1.1 vs. 3.9 ± 1.6 ml/kg/h, p = 0.021) and less crystalloid (3 ± 0 vs. 5.0 ± 2.8 ml/kg/h, p < 0.001) than the control group. ICU length of stay was shorter (3 days [1–5] vs. 6 days [3–11], p = 0.001) and ICU costs were lower in the GDFR group. The total number of complications (46 vs. 99, p = 0.043) and the proportion of patients who developed one or more complications (19.2 vs. 34.7%, p = 0.034) were smaller in the GDFR group.

No trial has previously examined whether exercising to neutral or into the hypermobile range affects outcomes. This study aimed to (i) determine if a physiotherapist-prescribed exercise programme focused on knee joint strength and control is effective in reducing knee pain in children with JHS compared to no treatment, and (ii) whether the range in which these exercises are performed affects outcomes.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: A prospective, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial conducted in a tertiary hospital in Sydney, Australia compared an 8 week exercise programme performed into either the full hypermobile range or only to neutral knee extension, following a minimum 2 week baseline period without treatment. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealed by sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes. Knee pain was the primary outcome. Quality of life, thigh muscle strength, and function were also measured at (i) initial assessment, (ii) following the baseline period and (iii) post treatment. Assessors were blinded to the participants' treatment allocation and participants blinded to the difference in the treatments.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Children with JHS and knee pain (n=26) aged 7-16 years were randomly assigned to the hypermobile (n=12) or neutral (n=14) treatment group. Significant improvements in child-reported maximal knee pain were found following treatment, regardless of group allocation with a mean 14.5 mm reduction on the visual analogue scale (95% CI 5.2 – 23.8 mm, p=0.003). Significant differences between treatment groups were noted for parent-reported overall psychosocial health (p=0.009), specifically self-esteem (p=0.034), mental health (p=0.001) and behaviour (p=0.019), in favour of exercising into the hypermobile range (n=11) compared to neutral only (n=14). Conversely, parent-reported overall physical health significantly favoured exercising only to neutral (p=0.037). No other differences were found between groups and no adverse events occurred.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Parents perceive improved child psychosocial health when children exercise into the hypermobile range, while exercising to neutral only is perceived to favour the child's physical health. A physiotherapist prescribed, supervised, individualised and progressed exercise programme effectively reduces knee pain in children with JHS.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australia & New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry; ACTRN12606000109505.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"physiotherapist-prescribed exercise programme\", \"no treatment\", \"child-reported maximal knee pain\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Significant improvements in child-reported maximal knee pain were found following treatment, regardless of group allocation with a mean 14.5 mm reduction on the visual analogue scale (95% CI 5.2 \\u2013 23.8 mm, p=0.003).\"], [\"physiotherapist-prescribed exercise programme\", \"no treatment\", \"adverse events\", \"no significant difference\", \"No other differences were found between groups and no adverse events occurred.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

In particular, data on quality of life is rarely reported. This is especially important because patients treated with hydrotherapy often report an enhanced sense of well-being. We report a randomised controlled trial in which we compared the effects of hydrotherapy with exercises on land on overall response to treatment, physical function and quality of life in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: One hundred and fifteen patients with RA were randomised to receive a weekly 30-minute session of hydrotherapy or similar exercises on land for 6 weeks. Our primary outcome was a self-rated global impression of change – a measure of treatment effect on a 7-point scale ranging from 1(very much worse) to 7 (very much better) assessed immediately on completion of treatment. Secondary outcomes including EuroQol health related quality of life, EuroQol health status valuation, HAQ, 10 metre walk time and pain scores were collected at baseline, after treatment and 3 months later. Binary outcomes were analysed by Fisher's exact test and continuous variables by Wilcoxon or Mann-Whitney tests.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Baseline characteristics of the two groups were comparable. Significantly more patients treated with hydrotherapy (40/46, 87%) were much better or very much better than the patients treated with land exercise (19/40, 47.5%), p < 0.001 Fisher's exact test. Eleven patients allocated land exercise failed to complete treatment compared with 4 patients allocated hydrotherapy (p = 0.09). Sensitivity analyses confirmed an advantage for hydrotherapy if we assumed non-completers would all not have responded (response rates 70% versus 38%; p < 0.001) or if we assumed that non-completers would have had the same response as completers (response rates 82% versus 55% p = 0.002). Ten metre walk time improved after treatment in both cases (median pre-treatment time for both groups combined 10.9 seconds, post-treatment 9.1 s, and 3 months later 9.6 s). There was however no difference between treatment groups. Similarly there were no significant differences between groups in terms of changes to HAQ, EQ-5D utility score, EQ VAS and pain VAS.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Patients with RA treated with hydrotherapy are more likely to report feeling much better or very much better than those treated with land exercises immediately on completion of the treatment programme. This perceived benefit was not reflected by differences between groups in 10-metre walk times, functional scores, quality of life measures and pain scores.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"receive a weekly 30-minute session of hydrotherapy for 6 weeks\", \"similar exercises on land for 6 weeks\", \"number of patients that feel much better\", \"significantly increased\", \"Significantly more patients treated with hydrotherapy (40/46, 87%) were much better or very much better than the patients treated with land exercise (19/40, 47.5%), p \\u003c 0.001 Fisher\\u0027s exact test.\"], [\"receive a weekly 30-minute session of hydrotherapy for 6 weeks\", \"similar exercises on land for 6 weeks\", \"number of patient failed to complete treatment\", \"no significant difference\", \"Eleven patients allocated land exercise failed to complete treatment compared with 4 patients allocated hydrotherapy (p = 0.09).\"], [\"receive a weekly 30-minute session of hydrotherapy for 6 weeks\", \"similar exercises on land for 6 weeks\", \"Ten-metre walk time\", \"no significant difference\", \"Ten metre walk time improved after treatment in both cases (median pre-treatment time for both groups combined 10.9 seconds, post-treatment 9.1 s, and 3 months later 9.6 s).

In each patient one ovary was randomly allocated to retrieval with either a 20 G/ 35 mm (thin) or 17 G/ 35 mm (standard) needle, the other ovary was then retrieved with the opposite needle.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The standard diameter needle was used to collect a total of 215 oocytes from 355 aspirated follicles (60.6%) compared to 203 oocytes from 352 aspirated follicles (57.7%) with the thinner needle (p = 0.23). Stratifying outcomes by anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), as indicator of ovarian reserve, and by body mass index (BMI) the oocyte yields, still, did not differ (AMH, r (17) = −0.20, p = 0.44; BMI, r (17) =0.02, p = 0.96). Outcomes also did not vary among women with diminished ovarian reserve (p = 0.17) and in women with normal ovarian reserve (p = 1.00). Operating time was, however, significantly increased by 3.3 minutes per ovary (z = −3.08, p = 0.002) with the thinner needle.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Needle diameter does not affect oocyte yield, including in obese patients and patients with diminished ovarian reserve.

This pilot study examined the effect of menu labeling with caloric information and exercise equivalents (EE) on food selection. Participants, 62 females, ages 18-34, recruited for this study, ordered a fast food meal with menus that contained the names of the food (Lunch 1 (L1), control meal). One week later (Lunch 2 (L2), experiment meal), participants ordered a meal from one of three menus with the same items as the previous week: no calorie information, calorie information only, or calorie information and EE.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: There were no absolute differences between groups in calories ordered from L1 to L2. However, it is noteworthy that calorie only and calorie plus exercise equivalents ordered about 16% (206 kcal) and 14% (162 kcal) fewer calories from Lunch 1 to Lunch 2, respectively; whereas, the no information group ordered only 2% (25 kcal) fewer.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Menu labeling alone may be insufficient to reduce calories; however, further research is needed in finding the most effective ways of presenting the menu labels for general public.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Lunch 2 (L2), experiment meal\", \"Lunch 1 (L1), control meal\", \"amount of calories\", \"no significant difference\", \"There were no absolute differences between groups in calories ordered from L1 to L2.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Applying an available and appropriate supplementary food is a major approach in treating children with Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM).\n\nABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of a new supplementary blended flour (containing chickpea, rice, wheat and barley, named Shadameen) in combination with multivitamin/mineral supplement and nutritional counseling versus multivitamin/mineral supplement and nutritional counseling alone, in the treatment of children with MAM.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: This randomized controlled trial study was conducted at Heshmatiyeh Hospital in Sabzevar city in Iran, from January 2016 to December 2016. Seventy infants, aged 9 to 24 months with MAM who were referred from urban health centers to the hospital clinic were included. They were randomly assigned to receive, for about 3 months, either multivitamin / mineral supplement and nutritional counseling alone or in combination with an extra supplementary blended food. We analyzed weight, length, weight for length Z score (WLZ), weight for age Z score (WAZ) and length for weight Z score (LAZ), along with recovery rate and adverse events among the two groups. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 16. We used statistics, Chi-square, independent t-test, and Fisher's exact test for the analyses of primary and secondary outcomes.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The food supplementation infant's mean weight and WLZ and WAZ were greater compared with the other group (0.81±0.29 gr and 0.55±0.33 gr, p=0.002), (0.36±0.36 and 0.02±0.52, p=0.003), (0.40±0.33 and 0.09±0.37, p=0.001). The recovery rate in the food supplemented group was significantly higher than the other group (68.4%, 31.6%, p=0.001). No adverse reactions were observed. There were no significant differences in LAZ at the end of the study between the two groups (p=0.53).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: This study showed that Shadameen in combination with multivitamin/mineral and counselling therapy can be more effective in decreasing the wasting rate of children with MAM than vitamin/mineral and counseling therapy alone.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (http://www.irct.ir) with the Irct ID: IRCT2015040921670N1.\n\nABSTRACT.FUNDING: This study was financially supported by the vice chancellor for research office, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"new supplementary blended flour (containing chickpea, rice, wheat and barley, named Shadameen)  \", \"multivitamin / mineral supplement and nutritional counseling alone\", \"The proportion of children who recovered\", \"significantly increased\", \"The food supplementation infant\\u2019s mean weight and WLZ and WAZ were greater compared with the other group (0.81\\u00b10.29 gr and 0.55\\u00b10.33 gr, p=0.002), (0.36\\u00b10.36 and 0.02\\u00b10.52, p=0.003), (0.40\\u00b10.33 and 0.09\\u00b10.37, p=0.001).

Caudal dexamethasone and magnesium could offer significant analgesic benefits. We compared the analgesic effects and side-effects of dexamethasone or magnesium added to caudal ropivacaine in pediatric patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:: A total of 105 (1-6 years) were randomly assigned into three groups in a double-blinded manner. After a standardized sevoflurane in oxygen anesthesia, each patient received a single caudal dose of ropivacaine 0.15% 1.5 mL/kg combined with either magnesium 50 mg in normal saline 1 mL (group RM), dexamethasone 0.1 mg/kg in normal saline 1 mL (group RD), or corresponding volume of normal saline (group R) according to group assignment. Postoperative analgesia, use of analgesics, and side-effects were assessed during the first 24 h.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: Addition of magnesium or dexamethasone to caudal ropivacaine significantly prolonged analgesia duration 8 (5-11) h and 12 (8-16) h, respectively compared with 4 (3-5) h with the use of ropivacaine alone. The incidence of postoperative rescue analgesia was significantly higher in group R compared with groups RM and RD. The time to 1st analgesic dose was significantly longer in groups RM and RD (500 ± 190 and 730 ± 260 min) respectively compared with group R (260 ± 65 min). Group R patients achieved significantly higher Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale and Faces Legs Activity Cry Consolability scores (4th hourly) compared with groups RM and RD patients (8th and 12th hourly, respectively).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: The addition of dexamethasone or magnesium to caudal ropivacaine significantly prolonged the duration of postoperative analgesia in children undergoing inguinal hernia repair. Also the time to 1st analgesic dose was longer and the need for rescue postoperative analgesic was reduced and without increase in incidence of side effects.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"magnesium 50 mg in normal saline 1 mL or dexamethasone 0.1 mg/kg in normal saline 1 mL\", \"corresponding volume of normal saline \", \"duration of postoperative analgesia \", \"significantly increased\", \"Addition of magnesium or dexamethasone to caudal ropivacaine significantly prolonged analgesia duration 8 (5-11) h and 12 (8-16) h, respectively compared with 4 (3-5) h with the use of ropivacaine alone.

The purpose of present study was to determine the effect of acute and 14-day Coenzyme Q10\nsupplementation on inflammatory, blood lactate and muscle damage in male middle-distance runners.\n <p> \nMethods: Eighteen male middle-distance runners in a randomized and quasi experimental study\nwere allocated into two equal groups: supplement group (n=9, Coenzyme Q10: 5mg/kg/day) and\nplacebo group (n= 9, Dextrose: 5mg/kg/day). After acute (1day) and 14-day supplementation, all\nsubjects were participated in a training like running (competitive 3000 meters). Blood samples were\nobtained in the four phases: one hour before and 18-24 hours after two running protocols. Lactate,\nserum interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), C-reactive protein (CRP) and\ncreatine kinase (CK) were analyzed. Repeated ANOVA and Bonferuni as a post hoc tests were used\nto determine the changes in four stages. Differences between groups were determined by t-test.\n <p> \nResults: The results showed that acute and short-term Coenzyme Q10 supplementation had not\nsignificant effect on basal parameters. The acute coenzyme Q10 supplementation attenuated only the\nexercise-induced increase in response of the plasma CRP. The short-term (14-day) coenzyme Q10\nsupplementation attenuated the exercise-induced increase in response of the lactate, serum interleukin-\n6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and CRP in male middle-distance runners. However, the acute\nand short-term coenzyme Q10 supplementation had not any significant effect on the exerciseinduced\nincrease response of total serum creatine kinase.\n <p> \nConclusion: Based on the present results, it can be concluded that the 14-day coenzyme Q10 supplementation\n(5mg.kg-1.day-1) is more effective than the acute supplementation to overcome the\nexercise-induced adverse responses in some oxidative, inflammatory and biochemical parameters.\nTherefore, short-term coenzyme Q10 supplementation is recommended to reduce exercise-induced\nadverse consequences.\n\n\nFindings:\n[[\"14-day coenzyme Q10 supplementation (5mg.kg-1.day-1)\", \"acute supplementation of Q10\", \"overcome the exercise-induced adverse responses\", \"significantly increased\", \"Based on the present results, it can be concluded that the 14-day coenzyme Q10 supplementation\\r\\r\\r\\r\\n(5mg.kg-1.day-1) is more effective than the acute supplementation to overcome the\\r\\r\\r\\r\\nexercise-induced adverse responses in some oxidative, inflammatory and biochemical parameters.\\r\\r\\r\\r\\nTherefore, short-term coenzyme Q10 supplementation is recommended to reduce exercise-induced\\r\\r\\r\\r\\nadverse consequences.\"], [\"acute coenzyme Q10 supplementation \", \"placebo\", \"exercise-induced increase in response of the plasma CRP\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The acute coenzyme Q10 supplementation attenuated only the\\r\\r\\r\\r\\nexercise-induced increase in response of the plasma CRP.

These data suggest that weight loss can spread within couples, and that widely available lifestyle programs have weight loss effects beyond the treated individual.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[[\"Weight Watchers\", \"self-guided control group\", \"weight loss of untreated spouses\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Untreated spouses lost weight at 3 months (WW = −1.5 ± 2.9 kg; SG = −1.1 ± 3.3 kg) and 6 months (WW = −2.2 ± 4.2 kg; SG = −1.9 ± 3.6 kg), but weight losses did not differ by condition.\"]]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[[\"Weight Watchers\", \"self-guided control group\", \"weight loss of untreated spouses\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Untreated spouses lost weight at 3 months (WW = −1.5 ± 2.9 kg; SG = −1.1 ± 3.3 kg) and 6 months (WW = −2.2 ± 4.2 kg; SG = −1.9 ± 3.6 kg), but weight losses did not differ by condition.\"]]"], "doc_hash": "3e863bb7008156e19d9ecff93077cb26d4c5c2a3ccc1ded8a083d06e0eb41adf", "prompt_hash": "3a3ef11d20e2cec131696340fd0e071d8b07810d31fde6294a27ddb82992ddfe", "target_hash": "27174d9b1cd624d7bc516e26dd15becbad33f1f0436923981002f4161080244f", "bypass": null}

The primary outcome was transepidermal water loss (TEWL) at 14 days postbirth; the predefined difference deemed to be unimportant was 1.2. Secondary outcomes comprised changes in stratum corneum hydration, skin surface pH, clinical observations of the skin, and maternal views.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Complete TEWL data were obtained for 242 (78.8%) infants. Wash was noninferior to water alone in terms of TEWL (intention-to-treat analysis: 95% confidence interval [CI] for difference [wash–water, adjusted for family history of eczema, neonate state, and baseline] −1.24, 1.07; per protocol analysis: 95% CI −1.42, 1.09).

The aim was to determine if a) a complex intervention in obese pregnant women leads to anticipated changes in diet and physical activity behaviours, and b) to refine the intervention protocol through process evaluation of intervention fidelity.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: We undertook a pilot RCT of a complex intervention in obese pregnant women, comparing routine antenatal care with an intervention to reduce dietary glycaemic load and saturated fat intake, and increase physical activity. Subjects included 183 obese pregnant women (mean BMI 36.3 kg/m2). <p> Diet was assessed by repeated triple pass 24-hour dietary recall and physical activity by accelerometry and questionnaire, at 16+0 to 18+6 and at 27+0 to 28+6 weeks' gestation in women in control and intervention arms. Attitudes to behaviour change and quality of life were assessed and a process evaluation undertaken. The full RCT protocol was undertaken to assess feasibility.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Compared to women in the control arm, women in the intervention arm had a significant reduction in dietary glycaemic load (33 points, 95% CI −47 to −20), (p < 0.001) and saturated fat intake (−1.6% energy, 95% CI −2.8 to −0. 3) at 28 weeks' gestation. Objectively measured physical activity did not change. Physical discomfort and sustained barriers to physical activity were common at 28 weeks' gestation. Process evaluation identified barriers to recruitment, group attendance and compliance, leading to modification of intervention delivery.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: This pilot trial of a complex intervention in obese pregnant women suggests greater potential for change in dietary intake than for change in physical activity, and through process evaluation illustrates the considerable advantage of performing an exploratory trial of a complex intervention in obese pregnant women before undertaking a large RCT.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Trial Registration Number: ISRCTN89971375\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"complex intervention\", \"routine antenatal care\", \"dietary glycaemic load\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Compared to women in the control arm, women in the intervention arm had a significant reduction in dietary glycaemic load (33 points, 95% CI \\u221247 to \\u221220), (p \\u0026lt; 0.001) and saturated fat intake (\\u22121.6% energy, 95% CI \\u22122.8 to \\u22120. 3) at 28 weeks\\u2019 gestation.\"], [\"complex intervention\", \"routine antenatal care\", \"dietary glycaemic load\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Compared to women in the control arm, women in the intervention arm had a significant reduction in dietary glycaemic load (33 points, 95% CI \\u221247 to \\u221220), (p \\u003c 0.001)\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:207"}, "target": "[[\"complex intervention\", \"routine antenatal care\", \"dietary glycaemic load\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Compared to women in the control arm, women in the intervention arm had a significant reduction in dietary glycaemic load (33 points, 95% CI \\u221247 to \\u221220), (p \\u0026lt; 0.001) and saturated fat intake (\\u22121.6% energy, 95% CI \\u22122.8 to \\u22120. 3) at 28 weeks\\u2019 gestation.\"], [\"complex intervention\", \"routine antenatal care\", \"dietary glycaemic load\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Compared to women in the control arm, women in the intervention arm had a significant reduction in dietary glycaemic load (33 points, 95% CI \\u221247 to \\u221220), (p \\u003c 0.001)\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

Combination therapy can both improve treatment and provide important public health benefits if it curbs the spread of parasites harbouring resistance genes. Thus, drug combinations must be identified which minimise gametocyte emergence in treated cases, and so prevent selective transmission of parasites resistant to any of the partner drugs.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS AND FINDINGS: In a randomised controlled trial, 497 children with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were treated with CQ and SP (three doses and one dose respectively; n = 91), or six doses of artemether in fixed combination with lumefantrine (co-artemether [Coartem, Riamet]) (n = 406). Carriage rates of Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes and trophozoites were measured 7, 14, and 28 d after treatment. The infectiousness of venous blood from 29 children carrying P. falciparum gametocytes 7 d after treatment was tested by membrane-feeding of Anopheles mosquitoes. <p> Children treated with co-artemether were significantly less likely to carry gametocytes within the 4 weeks following treatment than those receiving CQ/SP (30 of 378 [7.94%] versus 42 of 86 [48.8%]; p < 0.0001). Carriers in the co-artemether group harboured gametocytes at significantly lower densities, for shorter periods (0.3 d versus 4.2 d; p < 0.0001) and were less infectious to mosquitoes at day 7 (p < 0.001) than carriers who had received CQ/SP.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Co-artemether is highly effective at preventing post-treatment transmission of P. falciparum.

The aim was to determine if a) a complex intervention in obese pregnant women leads to anticipated changes in diet and physical activity behaviours, and b) to refine the intervention protocol through process evaluation of intervention fidelity.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: We undertook a pilot RCT of a complex intervention in obese pregnant women, comparing routine antenatal care with an intervention to reduce dietary glycaemic load and saturated fat intake, and increase physical activity. Subjects included 183 obese pregnant women (mean BMI 36.3 kg/m2). <p> Diet was assessed by repeated triple pass 24-hour dietary recall and physical activity by accelerometry and questionnaire, at 16+0 to 18+6 and at 27+0 to 28+6 weeks' gestation in women in control and intervention arms. Attitudes to behaviour change and quality of life were assessed and a process evaluation undertaken. The full RCT protocol was undertaken to assess feasibility.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Compared to women in the control arm, women in the intervention arm had a significant reduction in dietary glycaemic load (33 points, 95% CI −47 to −20), (p < 0.001) and saturated fat intake (−1.6% energy, 95% CI −2.8 to −0. 3) at 28 weeks' gestation. Objectively measured physical activity did not change. Physical discomfort and sustained barriers to physical activity were common at 28 weeks' gestation. Process evaluation identified barriers to recruitment, group attendance and compliance, leading to modification of intervention delivery.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: This pilot trial of a complex intervention in obese pregnant women suggests greater potential for change in dietary intake than for change in physical activity, and through process evaluation illustrates the considerable advantage of performing an exploratory trial of a complex intervention in obese pregnant women before undertaking a large RCT.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Trial Registration Number: ISRCTN89971375\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[[\"a complex intervention in obese pregnant women\", \"routine antenatal care\", \"dietary glycaemic load\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Compared to women in the control arm, women in the intervention arm had a significant reduction in dietary glycaemic load (33 points, 95% CI −47 to −20), (p < 0.001).\"], [\"a complex intervention in obese pregnant women\", \"routine antenatal care\", \"saturated fat intake\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Compared to women in the control arm, women in the intervention arm had a significant reduction in saturated fat intake (−1.6% energy, 95% CI −2.8 to −0. 3) at 28 weeks' gestation.\"]]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[[\"a complex intervention in obese pregnant women\", \"routine antenatal care\", \"dietary glycaemic load\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Compared to women in the control arm, women in the intervention arm had a significant reduction in dietary glycaemic load (33 points, 95% CI −47 to −20), (p < 0.001).\"], [\"a complex intervention in obese pregnant women\", \"routine antenatal care\", \"saturated fat intake\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Compared to women in the control arm, women in the intervention arm had a significant reduction in saturated fat intake (−1.6% energy, 95% CI −2.8 to −0. 3) at 28 weeks' gestation.\"]]"], "doc_hash": "6353fbad1171e4cf4fc94aa55c029843abcbb080c7c8e068917e3982f4964419", "prompt_hash": "4312f37dcc41c2e5485dc0229c6f2971a21340b786359a360d4f80b9f4c3105a", "target_hash": "54561b4dfc918b04aa47f3fd39170866e4ea853e05c861aea1e0f2f352742e58", "bypass": null}

The study had a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, cross-over design, with each of the two treatment periods lasting no more than 3 months. At the end of the study, patients were asked to assign preference to one of the treatments (primary endpoint). The number of pain-free (PF) and pain-relief (PR) episodes at 2 h, and number of recurrent and sustained pain-free (SPF) episodes within 48 h were the secondary study endpoints. Seventy-seven percent of patients expressed a preference. Average score of preference was 2.9 ± 1.3 (F) versus 3.0 ± 1.3 (Z; p = NS). Rate of PF episodes at 2 h was 26% with F and 31% with Z (p = NS). PR episodes at 2 h were 57% for F and 58% for Z (p = NS). Rate of recurrence was 21 (F) and 24% (Z; p = NS). Time to recurrence within 48 h was better for F especially between 4 and 16 h (p < 0.05). SPF episodes were 18 (F) versus 22% (Z; p = NS). Drug-related adverse events were significantly (p < 0.05) less under F (3 vs. 10).

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of rosuvastatin, alone or associated with zinc and selenium supplementation, on lipid profile, antioxidant enzymes and mineral status in coronary artery disease patients.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A double-blind randomized clinical trial was performed in which patients (n = 76) were treated with 10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months associated or not with zinc (30 mg/d) and selenium (150 μg/d) supplementation. The following parameters were analyzed before and after the intervention: anthropometric measurements, lipid profile, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), electronegative low density lipoprotein (LDL(-)) concentrations, activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), zinc and selenium concentrations in blood plasma and erythocytes. Significance was determined using an α of 5% (two-tailed).\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: We found that rosuvastatin therapy was efficient in reducing total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and hs-CRP independently of mineral supplementation. Neither treatment was associated with significant changes in LDL(-). Similarly, the antioxidant enzymes GPx and SOD activity were unchanged by treatments. Neither treatment was associated with significant differences in concentrations of zinc or selenium in blood plasma and erythocytes of studied groups.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Rosuvastatin treatment did not affect zinc and selenium levels in coronary artery disease patients. The zinc and selenium supplementation at doses used in this study did not change lipid profile or SOD and GPx activity in patients receiving rosuvastatin. Further studies should be focused on testing alternative doses and supplements in different populations to contribute for a consensus on the ideal choice of antioxidants to be used as possible complementary therapies in atherosclerotic patients.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01547377\n\n\nFindings:\n[[\"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months with zinc (30 mg/d) and selenium (150 I\\u03021\\u20444g/d) supplementation.\", \"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months\", \"glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels\", \"no significant difference\", \"Similarly, the activities of the antioxidant enzymes GPx and SOD were unchanged by treatments (P \\u003e 0.42) and were similar in both groups (P \\u003e 0.33).\"], [\"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months with zinc (30 mg/d) and selenium (150 I\\u03021\\u20444g/d) supplementation.\", \"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months\", \"glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels\", \"no significant difference\", \"Similarly, the antioxidant enzymes GPx and SOD activity were unchanged by treatments.\"], [\"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months with zinc (30 mg/d) and selenium (150 I\\u03021\\u20444g/d) supplementation.\", \"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months\", \"total cholesterol, LDL-c, and non-HDL-c levels\", \"no significant difference\", \"Significant decreases in total cholesterol, LDL-c, and non-HDL-c levels were observed for all patients, regardless of group; however, there were no differences between the rosuvastatin + mineral-supplemented and rosuvastatin + placebo groups (P \\u003e 0.21).\"], [\"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months with zinc (30 mg/d) and selenium (150 I\\u03021\\u20444g/d) supplementation.\", \"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months\", \"Triglycerides concentrations\", \"no significant difference\", \"Triglycerides concentrations dropped noticeably in both groups, though this pattern was significant only for the placebo group (P = 0.034); despite this, differences between the two groups were not significant (P = 0.76).\"], [\"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months with zinc (30 mg/d) supplementation.\", \"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months with selenium (150 I\\u03021\\u20444g/d) supplementation.\", \"concentrations of zinc and selenium of studied groups.\", \"no significant difference\", \"Neither treatment was associated with significant differences in concentrations of zinc (plasma: P \\u003e 0.14; erythrocyte: P \\u003e 0.14) or selenium (plasma: P \\u003e 0.63; erythrocyte: P \\u003e 0.07) of studied groups.\"], [\"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months with zinc (30 mg/d) supplementation.\", \"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months with selenium (150 I\\u03021\\u20444g/d) supplementation.\", \"concentrations of zinc and selenium of studied groups.\", \"no significant difference\", \"Neither treatment was associated with significant differences in concentrations of zinc or selenium in blood plasma and erythocytes of studied groups.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Because of the chronic nature of the disease, self-care is necessary. Education alone is not effective in providing care. Misunderstanding by the patients regarding diabetes during the training programs render telephone follow-up after training essential.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:: This quasi-experimental study with two groups (experimental and control) was conducted in two phases in 2014. The study population consisted of 70 children of 10–18 years of age with type I diabetes (35 patients in the experimental group and 35 in the control group). The participants were randomly selected from the patients referring to the Sedigheh Tahereh Diabetic Research and Treatment Center in Isfahan, Iran.

Patients were evaluated every 3 months and chemotherapy was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Overall response rate was the primary endpoint.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: 183 patients were included in the intent-to-treat analysis (92 TOMOX and 91 FOLFOX4). Overall response rate was 45.6 and 36.3 % (p = 0.003) for TOMOX and FOLFOX4, respectively. No statistically significant differences were observed in overall survival (15.6 and 17.2 months; p = 0.475); progression-free survival (7.7 and 8.7 months; p = 0.292), and response duration (6.4 and 7.6 months; p = 0.372) for TOMOX and FOLFOX4, respectively. Grades 3 and 4 neutropenia (p < 0.0001) and leukopenia (p = 0.028) were more common with the FOLFOX4 regimen, while hepatic disorders and asthenia were higher in TOMOX group (p = ns). There were two treatment-related deaths in the FOLFOX4 arm and one in the TOMOX arm. Quality of life analysis based on the SF-36 revealed differences between the two regimens for physical and mental composite scores after 6 weeks, and for body pain and emotional role functioning after 6 and 12 weeks; all of these favored the FOLFOX4 arm (p ≤ 0.05).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: TOMOX and FOLFOX4 seem to have similar efficacy and are well tolerated in the first-line treatment for advanced CRC with different profiles of toxicity.

We studied the effect of 14 weeks of beta-carotene supplementation (20 mg d-1) on the frequency of micronuclei in sputum in 114 heavy smokers in a double-blind trial. Micronuclei reflect DNA damage in exfoliated cells and may thus provide a marker of early-stage carcinogenesis. Pre-treatment blood levels of cotinine, beta-carotene, retinol and vitamins C and E were similar in the placebo group (n = 61) and the treatment group (n = 53). Plasma beta-carotene levels increased 13-fold in the treatment group during intervention. Initial micronuclei counts (per 3,000 cells) were higher in the treatment group than in the placebo group (5.0 vs 4.0, P < 0.05). During intervention, the treatment group showed a 47% decrease, whereas the placebo group showed a non-significant decrease (16%). After adjustment for the initial levels, the treatment group had 27% lower micronuclei counts than the placebo group at the end of the trial (95% CI: 9-41%). These results indicate that beta-carotene may reduce lung cancer risk in man by preventing DNA damage in early-stage carcinogenesis.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"beta-carotene supplementation (20 mg d-1)\", \"placebo\", \"Initial micronuclei counts (per 3,000 cells)\", \"significantly increased\", \"Initial micronuclei counts (per 3,000 cells) were higher in the treatment group than in the placebo group (5.0 vs 4.0, P \\u0026lt; 0.05).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

All patients received DFO at 50–60 mg/kg 12–24 hr/day sc or iv 7 times weekly, combined with either DFP 75 at mg/kg/day (combination arm) or placebo (DFO monotherapy arm). The primary endpoint was the change in LVEF by CMR.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Improvement in LVEF was significant in both study arms at 6 and 12 months (p = 0.04), normalizing ventricular function in 9/16 evaluable patients. With combination therapy, the LVEF increased from 49.9% to 55.2% (+5.3% p = 0.04; n = 10) at 6 months and to 58.3% at 12 months (+8.4% p = 0.04; n = 7). With DFO monotherapy, the LVEF increased from 52.8% to 55.7% (+2.9% p = 0.04; n = 6) at 6 months and to 56.9% at 12 months (+4.1% p = 0.04; n = 4). The LVEF trend did not reach statistical difference between study arms (p = 0.89). In 2 patients on DFO monotherapy during the study and in 1 patient on combined therapy during follow up, heart failure deteriorated fatally. The study was originally powered for 86 participants to determine a 5% difference in LVEF improvement between treatments. The study was prematurely terminated due to slow recruitment and with the achieved sample size of 20 patients there was 80% power to detect an 8.6% difference in EF, which was not demonstrated.

In Experiment 1, COCs (n = 420) were randomly assigned to four groups: 1) Control group: no treatment; 2) VS1 group: COCs were exposed to vitrification solution 1 (VS1) containing 7.5% ethylene glycol [EG] + 7.5% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] + 20% calf serum [CS] in TCM-199 at 37 C for 5 min; 3) VS1 + VS2 group: COCs were exposed to VS1 for 5 min followed by VS2 (15% EG + 15% DMSO + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS) at 37 C for 45–60 sec; and 4) Vitrified group: COCs were exposed to VS1 and VS2, loaded on cryotops, vitrified in liquid nitrogen and then warmed in TCM-199 + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS at 37 C for 1 min. In Experiment 2, COCs (n = 581) were assigned to the same groups, but those in VS1, VS1 + VS2 and Vitrified groups were sub-divided and exposed to the warming solution for either 1 or 5 min. After treatment and/or warming, all COCs in both experiments underwent in vitro maturation, in vitro fertilization and in vitro culture.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Cleavage and blastocyst rates did not differ among Control, VS1 and VS1 + VS2 groups in either experiment. In Experiment 2, there was no effect of time in the warming solution. <p> However, both cleavage and blastocyst rates were lower (P < 0.001) in the Vitrified group than in the Control, VS1 and VS1 + VS2 groups (40.9 and 1.6% vs 92.2 and 34.4%, 79.4 and 25.2%, and 80.2 and 20.8%, respectively in Experiment 1, and 25.0 and 1.7% vs 75.3 and 27.2%, 67.9 and 19.5%, and 62.7 and 22.5%, respectively in Experiment 2).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: The permeating cryoprotectants (EG and DMSO) present in VS1 and VS2 solutions and the time in the warming solution containing sucrose had no adverse effects on cleavage and blastocyst rates of immature bovine COCs.

All patients received DFO at 50–60 mg/kg 12–24 hr/day sc or iv 7 times weekly, combined with either DFP 75 at mg/kg/day (combination arm) or placebo (DFO monotherapy arm). The primary endpoint was the change in LVEF by CMR.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Improvement in LVEF was significant in both study arms at 6 and 12 months (p = 0.04), normalizing ventricular function in 9/16 evaluable patients. With combination therapy, the LVEF increased from 49.9% to 55.2% (+5.3% p = 0.04; n = 10) at 6 months and to 58.3% at 12 months (+8.4% p = 0.04; n = 7). With DFO monotherapy, the LVEF increased from 52.8% to 55.7% (+2.9% p = 0.04; n = 6) at 6 months and to 56.9% at 12 months (+4.1% p = 0.04; n = 4). The LVEF trend did not reach statistical difference between study arms (p = 0.89). In 2 patients on DFO monotherapy during the study and in 1 patient on combined therapy during follow up, heart failure deteriorated fatally. The study was originally powered for 86 participants to determine a 5% difference in LVEF improvement between treatments. The study was prematurely terminated due to slow recruitment and with the achieved sample size of 20 patients there was 80% power to detect an 8.6% difference in EF, which was not demonstrated. Myocardial T2* improved in both arms (combination +1.9 ± 1.6 ms p = 0.04; and DFO monotherapy +1.9 ± 1.4 ms p = 0.04), but with no significant difference between treatments (p = 0.65).

In the intervention groups, patients received customized mailed information or physicians received printed, prioritized lists of patients with recommended clinical actions and performance feedback. Hierarchical models were used to accommodate group random assignment.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Study interventions did not improve A1C test ordering (P = 0.35) and negatively affected LDL cholesterol test ordering (P < 0.001) in the 12 months postintervention. Interventions had no effect on LDL cholesterol values (P = 0.64), which improved in all groups over time. Interventions had a borderline unfavorable effect on A1C values among those with baseline A1C ≥7% (P = 0.10) and an unfavorable effect on A1C values among those with baseline A1C ≥8% (P < 0.01). Interventions did not reduce risky prescribing events or increase treatment intensification. Time to next visit was longer in all intervention groups compared with that for the control group (P < 0.05).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Providing customized decision support to physicians and/or patients did not improve quality or safety of diabetes care and worsened A1C control in patients with baseline A1C ≥8%.

Combination therapy can both improve treatment and provide important public health benefits if it curbs the spread of parasites harbouring resistance genes. Thus, drug combinations must be identified which minimise gametocyte emergence in treated cases, and so prevent selective transmission of parasites resistant to any of the partner drugs.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS AND FINDINGS: In a randomised controlled trial, 497 children with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were treated with CQ and SP (three doses and one dose respectively; n = 91), or six doses of artemether in fixed combination with lumefantrine (co-artemether [Coartem, Riamet]) (n = 406). Carriage rates of Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes and trophozoites were measured 7, 14, and 28 d after treatment. The infectiousness of venous blood from 29 children carrying P. falciparum gametocytes 7 d after treatment was tested by membrane-feeding of Anopheles mosquitoes. <p> Children treated with co-artemether were significantly less likely to carry gametocytes within the 4 weeks following treatment than those receiving CQ/SP (30 of 378 [7.94%] versus 42 of 86 [48.8%]; p < 0.0001). Carriers in the co-artemether group harboured gametocytes at significantly lower densities, for shorter periods (0.3 d versus 4.2 d; p < 0.0001) and were less infectious to mosquitoes at day 7 (p < 0.001) than carriers who had received CQ/SP.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Co-artemether is highly effective at preventing post-treatment transmission of P. falciparum.

In the intervention groups, patients received customized mailed information or physicians received printed, prioritized lists of patients with recommended clinical actions and performance feedback. Hierarchical models were used to accommodate group random assignment.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Study interventions did not improve A1C test ordering (P = 0.35) and negatively affected LDL cholesterol test ordering (P < 0.001) in the 12 months postintervention. Interventions had no effect on LDL cholesterol values (P = 0.64), which improved in all groups over time. Interventions had a borderline unfavorable effect on A1C values among those with baseline A1C ≥7% (P = 0.10) and an unfavorable effect on A1C values among those with baseline A1C ≥8% (P < 0.01). Interventions did not reduce risky prescribing events or increase treatment intensification. Time to next visit was longer in all intervention groups compared with that for the control group (P < 0.05).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Providing customized decision support to physicians and/or patients did not improve quality or safety of diabetes care and worsened A1C control in patients with baseline A1C ≥8%. Future researchers should consider providing point-of-care decision support with redesign of office systems and/or incentives to increase appropriate actions in response to decision-support information.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"customized feedback of clinical information\", \"neither patient nor physician\", \"A1C test ordering\", \"no significant difference\", \"Study interventions did not improve A1C test ordering (P = 0.35) and negatively affected LDL cholesterol test ordering (P < 0.001) in the 12 months postintervention.\"],\n    [\"customized feedback of clinical information\", \"neither patient nor physician\", \"A1C values\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Interventions had a borderline unfavorable effect on A1C values among those with baseline A1C ≥7% (P = 0.10) and an unfavorable effect on A1C values among those with baseline A1C ≥8% (P < 0.01).\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"customized feedback of clinical information\", \"neither patient nor physician\", \"A1C test ordering\", \"no significant difference\", \"Study interventions did not improve A1C test ordering (P = 0.35) and negatively affected LDL cholesterol test ordering (P < 0.001) in the 12 months postintervention.\"],\n    [\"customized feedback of clinical information\", \"neither patient nor physician\", \"A1C values\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Interventions had a borderline unfavorable effect on A1C values among those with baseline A1C ≥7% (P = 0.10) and an unfavorable effect on A1C values among those with baseline A1C ≥8% (P < 0.01).\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "d1b2cf476f8ac58430f46d7e9178c518cb4365ca07036935aea184f6148dc101", "prompt_hash": "3a37b6eb5f3f3e90e1350fa656936a660addf231458846283b485635b343110d", "target_hash": "0d30d36f7b91e78edb6a6d0d606fb9c9b5c6d5a499a3295538a3c02a511cbd73", "bypass": null}

Caudal dexamethasone and magnesium could offer significant analgesic benefits. We compared the analgesic effects and side-effects of dexamethasone or magnesium added to caudal ropivacaine in pediatric patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:: A total of 105 (1-6 years) were randomly assigned into three groups in a double-blinded manner. After a standardized sevoflurane in oxygen anesthesia, each patient received a single caudal dose of ropivacaine 0.15% 1.5 mL/kg combined with either magnesium 50 mg in normal saline 1 mL (group RM), dexamethasone 0.1 mg/kg in normal saline 1 mL (group RD), or corresponding volume of normal saline (group R) according to group assignment.

It is a soft tissue disorder that causes significant disability and pain. <p> The aim of the study was to establish that an intramuscular steroid injection is effective in the short-term pain relief and functional improvement of tennis elbow. The severity of pain at the injection site was monitored to determine whether the intramuscular injection is better tolerated than the intralesional injection.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS AND RESULTS: 19 patients, who had no treatment for tennis elbow in the preceding 3 months, were recruited from Whipps Cross University Hospital, London, and were randomised to receive either 80 mg of intramuscular Depo-Medrone or 40 mg of intralesional Depo-Medrone injection. Blinding proved difficult as the injection sites differed and placebo arms were not included in the study. A Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) Questionnaire and a 10-point Likert scale were used to assess primary outcome. Six weeks after the treatment, there was a reduction in pain, improvement in function and total PRTEE scores in both intramuscular and intralesional groups (p=0.008) using a 95% CI for mean treatment difference of −26 to +16 points. A statistically significant result (p=0.001) in favour of intramuscular causing less pain at the injection site was noted.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Non-inferiority of intramuscular to intralesional injections was not confirmed; however, the intramuscular injection proved to be effective in reducing tennis elbow-related symptoms and was found less painful at the site of injection at the time of administration.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: EUDRACT Number: 2010-022131-11. <p> REC Number: 10/H0718/76 (NRES, Central London REC 1).\n\nFindings:\n[[\"80\\u2009mg of intramuscular Depo-Medrone\", \"40\\u2009mg of intralesional Depo-Medrone\", \"pain at the injection site\", \"significantly decreased\", \"A statistically significant result (p=0.001) in favour of intramuscular causing less pain at the injection site was noted.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Use of low-dose spinal anesthetic drug with adjuvants is desirable. This study compares the sensorimotor effects of addition of buprenorphine or dexmedetomidine to low-dose bupivacaine.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS:: Sixty patients were randomly allocated to three different groups. All received 1.8 mL 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine intrathecally. Sterile water (0.2 mL) or buprenorphine (60 μg) or dexmedetomidine (5 μg) was added to control group (Group C), buprenorphine group (Group B), and dexmedetomidine group (Group D), respectively. Time to the first analgesic request was the primary objective, and other objectives included the level of sensory-motor block, time to two-segment regression, time to S1 sensory regression and time to complete motor recovery. ANOVA and post hoc test were used for statistical analysis. The value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: All sixty patients completed the study. Postoperative analgesia was not required in the first 24 h in a total of 10 (50%), 12 (60%) and 15 (75%) patients in groups C, B, and D, respectively.

This study aims to assess changes in attitudes toward patient safety culture and frequency of quality-related event (QRE) reporting after guided implementation of a continuous quality improvement (CQI) program in a panel of community pharmacies in the United States (U.S.).\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Twenty-one community pharmacies volunteered to participate in the project and were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. Pharmacy staff in the intervention group received guided training to ensure full implementation of a CQI program while those in the control group partially implemented the program. Pharmacy staff in both groups completed retrospective pre-post safety culture questionnaires and reported medication errors and near misses that occurred in their practices. Rasch analysis was applied to assess questionnaire validity and reliability and to confirm if the ordinal level data approximated interval level measures. Paired t-tests and repeated measure analysis of covariance tests were subsequently used to compare observed changes in the attitudes of subjects and frequency of QREs reporting in intervention and control groups.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Sixty-nine employees completed the questionnaire, a 43.9% response rate. Improvement in attitudes toward patient safety was statistically significant in the intervention group in six domains: staff, training, and skill (p = 0.017); patient counseling (p = 0.043); communication about mistakes (p < 0.001); response to mistakes (p < 0.001); organizational learning – continuous improvement (p < 0.001); and overall patient safety perceptions (p = 0.033). No significant differences were observed in QRE reporting rates between intervention and control groups. However, differences were observed in the types of QREs reported (e.g., incorrect safety cap) and the point in the prescription processing workflow where a QRE was detected (e.g., partner check station, and drug utilization review station) in the intervention group (p < 0.001).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Guided CQI program implementation increased the self-reported patient safety culture attitudes among staff.\n\nABSTRACT.ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (10.1186/s40545-017-0114-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Continuous quality improvement program\", \"Control\", \"Communication about mistakes\", \"significantly increased\", \"Improvement in attitudes toward patient safety was statistically significant in the intervention group in six domains: staff, training, and skill (p = 0.017); patient counseling (p = 0.043); communication about mistakes (p \\u003c 0.001); response to mistakes (p \\u003c 0.001); organizational learning \\u2013 continuous improvement (p \\u003c 0.001); and overall patient safety perceptions (p = 0.033).\"], [\"Continuous quality improvement program\", \"Control\", \"Patient counseling\", \"significantly increased\", \".

Use of low-dose spinal anesthetic drug with adjuvants is desirable. This study compares the sensorimotor effects of addition of buprenorphine or dexmedetomidine to low-dose bupivacaine.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS:: Sixty patients were randomly allocated to three different groups. All received 1.8 mL 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine intrathecally. Sterile water (0.2 mL) or buprenorphine (60 μg) or dexmedetomidine (5 μg) was added to control group (Group C), buprenorphine group (Group B), and dexmedetomidine group (Group D), respectively. Time to the first analgesic request was the primary objective, and other objectives included the level of sensory-motor block, time to two-segment regression, time to S1 sensory regression and time to complete motor recovery. ANOVA and post hoc test were used for statistical analysis. The value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: All sixty patients completed the study. Postoperative analgesia was not required in the first 24 h in a total of 10 (50%), 12 (60%) and 15 (75%) patients in groups C, B, and D, respectively. Time to S1 regression was 130 ± 46 min (Group C), 144 ± 51.3 min (Group B) and 164 ± 55.99 min (Group D), P = 0.117.

The intervention group attended individual sessions with an experienced clinician once a week for 10 weeks and performed daily home exercises with adherence monitored by a self-report diary. The control group received no treatment. Blinded assessment was conducted at baseline and 11 weeks. Questionnaires assessed self-reported changes in back pain, physical function, and health-related quality of life. Objective measures of thoracic kyphosis, back and shoulder muscle endurance (Timed Loaded Standing Test), and function (Timed Up and Go test) were also taken.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the intervention group showed significant reductions in pain during movement (mean difference (95% CI) -1.8 (-3.5 to -0.1)) and at rest (-2.0 (-3.8 to -0.2)) and significantly greater improvements in Qualeffo physical function (-4.8 (-9.2 to -0.5)) and the Timed Loaded Standing test (46.7 (16.1 to 77.3) secs). For the perceived change in back pain over the 10 weeks, 9/11 (82%) participants in the intervention group rated their pain as 'much better' compared with only 1/9 (11%) participants in the control group.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Despite the modest sample size, these results support the benefits of exercise and manual therapy in the clinical management of patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures, but need to be confirmed in a larger sample.\n\nABSTRACT.TRAIL REGISTRATION: NCT00638768\n\nFindings:\n[[\"attended individual sessions with an experienced clinician once a week for 10 weeks and performed daily home exercises with adherence monitored by a self-report diary\", \"received no treatment\", \"pain during movement\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Compared with the control group, the intervention group showed significant reductions in pain during movement (mean difference (95% CI) -1.8 (-3.5 to -0.1))\"], [\"attended individual sessions with an experienced clinician once a week for 10 weeks and performed daily home exercises with adherence monitored by a self-report diary\", \"received no treatment\", \"Pain on rest (0-10)\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Compared with the control group, the intervention group showed significant reductions in pain during movement (mean difference (95% CI) -1.8 (-3.5 to -0.1)) and at rest (-2.0 (-3.8 to -0.2)) and\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate weight loss in patients with SCCHN undergoing two different radiotherapy (RT) schedules.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Nutritional data were analyzed from the ARTSCAN study, a controlled randomized prospective Swedish multicenter study conducted with the aim of comparing conventional fractionation (2.0 Gy per day, total 68 Gy during 7 weeks) and accelerated fractionation (1.1 + 2.0 Gy per day, total 68 Gy during 4.5 weeks). Seven hundred and fifty patients were randomized and 712 patients were followed from the start of RT in the present nutritional study.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The patients had a weight loss of 11.3% (± 8.6%) during the acute phase (start of RT up to five months after the termination of RT). No difference in weight loss was seen between the two RT fractionation schedules (p = 0.839). Three factors were significantly predictive for weight loss during the acute phase, i.e. tumor site, overweight/obesity or lack of tube feeding at the start of RT. Moreover, the nadir point of weight loss occurred at five months after the termination of RT.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: The results of the present study showed no difference in weight loss between the two RT fractionation schedules and also highlight that weight loss in SCCHN is a multifactorial problem. Moreover, the nadir of weight loss occurred at five months after the termination of treatment which calls for more intense nutritional interventions during the period after treatment.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"conventional fractionation (2.0 Gy per day, total 68 Gy during 7 weeks)\", \"accelerated fractionation (1.1 + 2.0 Gy per day, total 68 Gy during 4.5 weeks)\", \"weight loss\", \"no significant difference\", \"No difference in weight loss was seen between the two RT fractionation schedules (p = 0.839).\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:215"}, "target": "[[\"conventional fractionation (2.0 Gy per day, total 68 Gy during 7 weeks)\", \"accelerated fractionation (1.1 + 2.0 Gy per day, total 68 Gy during 4.5 weeks)\", \"weight loss\", \"no significant difference\", \"No difference in weight loss was seen between the two RT fractionation schedules (p = 0.839).\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

In this retrospective pooled analysis of these studies we assessed whether the zofenopril effect is influenced by gender.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: the four double-blind, randomized, parallel-group SMILE studies, compared the efficacy and safety of 6–48 week treatment with zofenopril 60 mg/day with that of placebo, lisinopril 10 mg/day or ramipril 10 mg/day in 3630 AMI patients. This pooled analysis compared treatment efficacy (1-year combined occurrence of death or hospitalization for CV causes) in 2733 men and 897 women.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: women were older than men, had a higher prevalence of diabetes and of other major CV risk factors. The risk of a major CV event was significantly larger for women (23% vs. 17% men, p<0.001). Between-gender risk difference was more marked for people living in Southern (+54%) than in Northern Europe (+12%). In both genders zofenopril similarly reduced the 1-year risk of CV morbidity and mortality vs. placebo (−39% men, p = 0.0001; −40% women, p = 0.005). The risk reduction was more marked with zofenopril than with the other ACEIs, particularly in men (−27%, p = 0.012; women: −14%, p = 0.479). The drug safety profile was similar between genders in zofenopril-treated patients, while it was worse in women treated with other ACEIs.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: post-AMI women are at higher risk of CV complications than men, particularly when living in Mediterranean countries. Their response to ACE-inhibition varies according to the type of drug and is usually better in men.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"zofenopril 60 mg/day\", \"placebo\", \"risk of 1-year CV morbidity and mortality \", \"significantly decreased\", \"In both genders zofenopril similarly reduced the 1-year risk of CV morbidity and mortality vs. placebo (\\u221239% men, p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0001; \\u221240% women, p\\u200a=\\u200a0.005).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate weight loss in patients with SCCHN undergoing two different radiotherapy (RT) schedules.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Nutritional data were analyzed from the ARTSCAN study, a controlled randomized prospective Swedish multicenter study conducted with the aim of comparing conventional fractionation (2.0 Gy per day, total 68 Gy during 7 weeks) and accelerated fractionation (1.1 + 2.0 Gy per day, total 68 Gy during 4.5 weeks). Seven hundred and fifty patients were randomized and 712 patients were followed from the start of RT in the present nutritional study.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The patients had a weight loss of 11.3% (± 8.6%) during the acute phase (start of RT up to five months after the termination of RT). No difference in weight loss was seen between the two RT fractionation schedules (p = 0.839). Three factors were significantly predictive for weight loss during the acute phase, i.e. tumor site, overweight/obesity or lack of tube feeding at the start of RT. Moreover, the nadir point of weight loss occurred at five months after the termination of RT.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: The results of the present study showed no difference in weight loss between the two RT fractionation schedules and also highlight that weight loss in SCCHN is a multifactorial problem. Moreover, the nadir of weight loss occurred at five months after the termination of treatment which calls for more intense nutritional interventions during the period after treatment.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[[\"conventional fractionation (2.0 Gy per day, total 68 Gy during 7 weeks)\", \"accelerated fractionation (1.1 + 2.0 Gy per day, total 68 Gy during 4.5 weeks)\", \"weight loss\", \"no significant difference\", \"No difference in weight loss was seen between the two RT fractionation schedules (p = 0.839).\"]]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[[\"conventional fractionation (2.0 Gy per day, total 68 Gy during 7 weeks)\", \"accelerated fractionation (1.1 + 2.0 Gy per day, total 68 Gy during 4.5 weeks)\", \"weight loss\", \"no significant difference\", \"No difference in weight loss was seen between the two RT fractionation schedules (p = 0.839).\"]]"], "doc_hash": "619912fbb13b2e2201c44737636d5ea35eb4bed4a400ca56808965dac594ab6c", "prompt_hash": "ba590ae61543665c08f12cbb44f4f7c3eebba76ee643b8f64994a93a9d18fb45", "target_hash": "5875b499e8812d35bd4b131bc9ea3a10040d01024a2a3bda547f86b11eade96f", "bypass": null}

However, a correlation between the neuropeptide oxytocin in cerebrospinal fluid and the severity of OCD has previously been shown, and oxytocin and serotonin are interconnected within the brain. Few studies have investigated whether SRIs have any effect on oxytocin; thus, our aim was to explore the possibility that oxytocinergic mechanisms contribute to the anti-obsessive effect of SRIs.\n\nABSTRACT.METHOD: In a randomized, double-blind trial, comparing SRIs (clomipramine and paroxetine) with placebo in 36 adults with OCD (characterized for subtypes), plasma oxytocin was measured with radioimmunoassay after plasma extraction, at baseline, after 1 week, and after 4 weeks of treatment, and related to baseline severity and clinical response after 12 weeks, as measured by the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS).\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Baseline oxytocin levels correlated positively with baseline Y-BOCS ratings, but only among the future SRI responders. Patients with early onset of OCD had higher baseline oxytocin. During treatment, plasma oxytocin did not differ between SRI and placebo treatment. In SRI responders, plasma oxytocin first decreased and then increased; in non-responders (to SRI as well as to placebo), the reverse was the case. After 4 weeks, treatment responders had attained higher oxytocin levels compared to non-responders. The intra-individual range (i.e. the variability) of plasma oxytocin between measurements was the measure that best differentiated responders from non-responders. This range was higher in responders than non-responders, and lower in patients with autistic traits.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: SRIs have highly variable effects on plasma oxytocin between individuals. The associations between baseline oxytocin and OCD severity and between oxytocin changes and treatment response support the notions that oxytocin is involved in OCD pathophysiology, and that the anti-obsessive effects of SRIs are partly exerted through oxytocinergic mechanisms.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"SRIs (clomipramine and paroxetine)\", \"placebo\", \"oxytocin levels\", \"no significant difference\", \"During treatment, plasma oxytocin did not differ between SRI and placebo treatment.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Intervention group (IG) and control group (CG) were split equally between governmental and private schools. Three educational in-person parents and children sessions were held at 2-month intervals to promote healthy eating habits and exercise. To reinforce the information, a website provided extensive discussion on a new topic every 2 weeks, including school snack menus and tools to calculate body mass index in children and adults. Text messages were sent to parents' mobile phones reinforcing the information provided. The IG contained 226 children and CG 181 children.

Vital signs, fluid intake, and laboratory and urinary data were assessed to determine the pharmacological effects after administration of aquaretic and natriuretic drugs.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: A total of 56 patients were randomized to receive either tolvaptan (n = 28) or furosemide (n = 28). In the combination and conventional diuretic groups, the average decrease in body weight from the baseline was 3.21 ± 3.17 kg (P < 0.0001) and 1.75 ± 2.36 kg (P = 0.0006), respectively, when measured on the final dosing day. Following 1 wk of treatment, a significantly greater reduction in body weight was observed in the combination diuretic group compared to that in the conventional diuretic group (P = 0.0412).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Compared to a conventional diuretic therapy with only a natriuretic drug, a combination diuretic therapy with natriuretic and aquaretic drugs is more effective for patients with cirrhotic ascites.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[[\"combination diuretic therapy with natriuretic and aquaretic drugs\", \"conventional diuretic therapy with only a natriuretic drug\", \"body weight\", \"significantly decreased\", \"a significantly greater reduction in body weight was observed in the combination diuretic group compared to that in the conventional diuretic group (P = 0.0412).\"]]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[[\"combination diuretic therapy with natriuretic and aquaretic drugs\", \"conventional diuretic therapy with only a natriuretic drug\", \"body weight\", \"significantly decreased\", \"a significantly greater reduction in body weight was observed in the combination diuretic group compared to that in the conventional diuretic group (P = 0.0412).\"]]"], "doc_hash": "e28673f6f21c360f78dc72c455813511cd7abcae3198ff13066a61091df8b187", "prompt_hash": "877ec6ffc6fc9ebf25aee71f88da9e0e55182d8199151e591cdea49f423148d2", "target_hash": "f5942de949bcbb3fa2ed17d4077ed3de2bfa141d160e230855380087e5115682", "bypass": null}

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of rosuvastatin, alone or associated with zinc and selenium supplementation, on lipid profile, antioxidant enzymes and mineral status in coronary artery disease patients.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A double-blind randomized clinical trial was performed in which patients (n = 76) were treated with 10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months associated or not with zinc (30 mg/d) and selenium (150 μg/d) supplementation. The following parameters were analyzed before and after the intervention: anthropometric measurements, lipid profile, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), electronegative low density lipoprotein (LDL(-)) concentrations, activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), zinc and selenium concentrations in blood plasma and erythocytes. Significance was determined using an α of 5% (two-tailed).\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: We found that rosuvastatin therapy was efficient in reducing total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and hs-CRP independently of mineral supplementation. Neither treatment was associated with significant changes in LDL(-). Similarly, the antioxidant enzymes GPx and SOD activity were unchanged by treatments. Neither treatment was associated with significant differences in concentrations of zinc or selenium in blood plasma and erythocytes of studied groups.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Rosuvastatin treatment did not affect zinc and selenium levels in coronary artery disease patients. The zinc and selenium supplementation at doses used in this study did not change lipid profile or SOD and GPx activity in patients receiving rosuvastatin. Further studies should be focused on testing alternative doses and supplements in different populations to contribute for a consensus on the ideal choice of antioxidants to be used as possible complementary therapies in atherosclerotic patients.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01547377\n\n\nFindings:\n[[\"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months with zinc (30 mg/d) and selenium (150 I\\u03021\\u20444g/d) supplementation.\", \"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months\", \"glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels\", \"no significant difference\", \"Similarly, the activities of the antioxidant enzymes GPx and SOD were unchanged by treatments (P \\u003e 0.42) and were similar in both groups (P \\u003e 0.33).\"], [\"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months with zinc (30 mg/d) and selenium (150 I\\u03021\\u20444g/d) supplementation.\", \"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months\", \"glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels\", \"no significant difference\", \"Similarly, the antioxidant enzymes GPx and SOD activity were unchanged by treatments.\"], [\"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months with zinc (30 mg/d) and selenium (150 I\\u03021\\u20444g/d) supplementation.\", \"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months\", \"total cholesterol, LDL-c, and non-HDL-c levels\", \"no significant difference\", \"Significant decreases in total cholesterol, LDL-c, and non-HDL-c levels were observed for all patients, regardless of group; however, there were no differences between the rosuvastatin + mineral-supplemented and rosuvastatin + placebo groups (P \\u003e 0.21).\"], [\"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months with zinc (30 mg/d) and selenium (150 I\\u03021\\u20444g/d) supplementation.\", \"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months\", \"Triglycerides concentrations\", \"no significant difference\", \"Triglycerides concentrations dropped noticeably in both groups, though this pattern was significant only for the placebo group (P = 0.034); despite this, differences between the two groups were not significant (P = 0.76).\"], [\"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months with zinc (30 mg/d) supplementation.\", \"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months with selenium (150 I\\u03021\\u20444g/d) supplementation.\", \"concentrations of zinc and selenium of studied groups.\", \"no significant difference\", \"Neither treatment was associated with significant differences in concentrations of zinc (plasma: P \\u003e 0.14; erythrocyte: P \\u003e 0.14) or selenium (plasma: P \\u003e 0.63; erythrocyte: P \\u003e 0.07) of studied groups.\"], [\"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months with zinc (30 mg/d) supplementation.\", \"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months with selenium (150 I\\u03021\\u20444g/d) supplementation.\", \"concentrations of zinc and selenium of studied groups.\", \"no significant difference\", \"Neither treatment was associated with significant differences in concentrations of zinc or selenium in blood plasma and erythocytes of studied groups.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

However, the individual and combined effects of whey protein and carbohydrates on long-term resistance training adaptations are poorly understood.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: A four-week preparatory RT period was conducted in previously untrained males to standardize the training background of the subjects. Thereafter, the subjects were randomized into three groups: 30 g of whey proteins (n = 22), isocaloric carbohydrates (maltodextrin, n = 21), or protein + carbohydrates (n = 25). Within these groups, the subjects were further randomized into two whole-body 12-week RT regimens aiming either for muscle hypertrophy and maximal strength or muscle strength, hypertrophy and power. The post-exercise drink was always ingested immediately after the exercise bout, 2–3 times per week depending on the training period. Body composition (by DXA), quadriceps femoris muscle cross-sectional area (by panoramic ultrasound), maximal strength (by dynamic and isometric leg press) and serum lipids as basic markers of cardiovascular health, were analysed before and after the intervention.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Twelve-week RT led to increased fat-free mass, muscle size and strength independent of post-exercise nutrient intake (P < 0.05). However, the whey protein group reduced more total and abdominal area fat when compared to the carbohydrate group independent of the type of RT (P < 0.05). Thus, a larger relative increase (per kg bodyweight) in fat-free mass was observed in the protein vs. carbohydrate group (P < 0.05) without significant differences to the combined group. No systematic effects of the interventions were found for serum lipids. The RT type did not have an effect on the adaptations in response to different supplementation paradigms.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Post-exercise supplementation with whey proteins when compared to carbohydrates or combination of proteins and carbohydrates did not have a major effect on muscle size or strength when ingested two to three times a week. However, whey proteins may increase abdominal fat loss and relative fat-free mass adaptations in response to resistance training when compared to fast-acting carbohydrates.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"30\\u0026nbsp;g of whey proteins,\", \" isocaloric carbohydrates (maltodextrin)\", \"total and abdominal area fat\", \"significantly decreased\", \"However, the whey protein group reduced more total and abdominal area fat when compared to the carbohydrate group independent of the type of RT (P\\u2009\\u0026lt;\\u20090.05).\"], [\"30\\u0026nbsp;g of whey proteins,\", \" isocaloric carbohydrates (maltodextrin)\", \"total and abdominal area fat\", \"significantly decreased\", \"However, the whey protein group reduced more total and abdominal area fat when compared to the carbohydrate group independent of the type of RT (P\\u2009\\u003c\\u20090.05).\"], [\"30g of whey proteins,\", \" isocaloric carbohydrates (maltodextrin)\", \"fat-free mass\", \"significantly increased\", \"Thus, a larger relative increase (per kg bodyweight) in fat-free mass was observed in the protein vs. carbohydrate group (P\\u2009\\u0026lt;\\u20090.05) without significant differences to the combined group.\"], [\"30g of whey proteins,\", \" isocaloric carbohydrates (maltodextrin)\", \"fat-free mass\", \"significantly increased\", \"a larger relative increase (per kg bodyweight) in fat-free mass was observed in the protein vs. carbohydrate group (P\\u2009\\u003c\\u20090.05) without significant differences to the combined group.\"], [\"protein\\u2009+\\u2009carbohydrates\", \" isocaloric carbohydrates (maltodextrin)\", \"serum lipids\", \"no significant difference\", \"No systematic effects of the interventions were found for serum lipids.\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:219"}, "target": "[[\"30\\u0026nbsp;g of whey proteins,\", \" isocaloric carbohydrates (maltodextrin)\", \"total and abdominal area fat\", \"significantly decreased\", \"However, the whey protein group reduced more total and abdominal area fat when compared to the carbohydrate group independent of the type of RT (P\\u2009\\u0026lt;\\u20090.05).\"], [\"30\\u0026nbsp;g of whey proteins,\", \" isocaloric carbohydrates (maltodextrin)\", \"total and abdominal area fat\", \"significantly decreased\", \"However, the whey protein group reduced more total and abdominal area fat when compared to the carbohydrate group independent of the type of RT (P\\u2009\\u003c\\u20090.05).\"], [\"30g of whey proteins,\", \" isocaloric carbohydrates (maltodextrin)\", \"fat-free mass\", \"significantly increased\", \"Thus, a larger relative increase (per kg bodyweight) in fat-free mass was observed in the protein vs. carbohydrate group (P\\u2009\\u0026lt;\\u20090.05) without significant differences to the combined group.\"], [\"30g of whey proteins,\", \" isocaloric carbohydrates (maltodextrin)\", \"fat-free mass\", \"significantly increased\", \"a larger relative increase (per kg bodyweight) in fat-free mass was observed in the protein vs. carbohydrate group (P\\u2009\\u003c\\u20090.05) without significant differences to the combined group.\"], [\"protein\\u2009+\\u2009carbohydrates\", \" isocaloric carbohydrates (maltodextrin)\", \"serum lipids\", \"no significant difference\", \"No systematic effects of the interventions were found for serum lipids.\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

In the intervention groups, patients received customized mailed information or physicians received printed, prioritized lists of patients with recommended clinical actions and performance feedback. Hierarchical models were used to accommodate group random assignment.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Study interventions did not improve A1C test ordering (P = 0.35) and negatively affected LDL cholesterol test ordering (P < 0.001) in the 12 months postintervention. Interventions had no effect on LDL cholesterol values (P = 0.64), which improved in all groups over time. Interventions had a borderline unfavorable effect on A1C values among those with baseline A1C ≥7% (P = 0.10) and an unfavorable effect on A1C values among those with baseline A1C ≥8% (P < 0.01). Interventions did not reduce risky prescribing events or increase treatment intensification. Time to next visit was longer in all intervention groups compared with that for the control group (P < 0.05).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Providing customized decision support to physicians and/or patients did not improve quality or safety of diabetes care and worsened A1C control in patients with baseline A1C ≥8%.

However, the individual and combined effects of whey protein and carbohydrates on long-term resistance training adaptations are poorly understood.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: A four-week preparatory RT period was conducted in previously untrained males to standardize the training background of the subjects. Thereafter, the subjects were randomized into three groups: 30 g of whey proteins (n = 22), isocaloric carbohydrates (maltodextrin, n = 21), or protein + carbohydrates (n = 25). Within these groups, the subjects were further randomized into two whole-body 12-week RT regimens aiming either for muscle hypertrophy and maximal strength or muscle strength, hypertrophy and power. The post-exercise drink was always ingested immediately after the exercise bout, 2–3 times per week depending on the training period. Body composition (by DXA), quadriceps femoris muscle cross-sectional area (by panoramic ultrasound), maximal strength (by dynamic and isometric leg press) and serum lipids as basic markers of cardiovascular health, were analysed before and after the intervention.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Twelve-week RT led to increased fat-free mass, muscle size and strength independent of post-exercise nutrient intake (P < 0.05). However, the whey protein group reduced more total and abdominal area fat when compared to the carbohydrate group independent of the type of RT (P < 0.05). Thus, a larger relative increase (per kg bodyweight) in fat-free mass was observed in the protein vs. carbohydrate group (P < 0.05) without significant differences to the combined group. No systematic effects of the interventions were found for serum lipids. The RT type did not have an effect on the adaptations in response to different supplementation paradigms.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Post-exercise supplementation with whey proteins when compared to carbohydrates or combination of proteins and carbohydrates did not have a major effect on muscle size or strength when ingested two to three times a week. However, whey proteins may increase abdominal fat loss and relative fat-free mass adaptations in response to resistance training when compared to fast-acting carbohydrates.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"post-exercise supplementation with whey proteins\", \"carbohydrates\", \"total and abdominal area fat\", \"significantly decreased\", \"the whey protein group reduced more total and abdominal area fat when compared to the carbohydrate group independent of the type of RT (P < 0.05).\"],\n    [\"post-exercise supplementation with whey proteins\", \"carbohydrates\", \"fat-free mass\", \"significantly increased\", \"a larger relative increase (per kg bodyweight) in fat-free mass was observed in the protein vs. carbohydrate group (P < 0.05) without significant differences to the combined group.\"],\n    [\"post-exercise supplementation with whey proteins\", \"carbohydrates or combination of proteins and carbohydrates\", \"muscle size or strength\", \"no significant difference\", \"Twelve-week RT led to increased fat-free mass, muscle size and strength independent of post-exercise nutrient intake (P < 0.05).\"],\n    [\"post-exercise supplementation with whey proteins\", \"null\", \"serum lipids\", \"no significant difference\", \"No systematic effects of the interventions were found for serum lipids.\"],\n    [\"post-exercise supplementation with whey proteins\", \"carbohydrates or combination of proteins and carbohydrates\", \"abdominal fat loss and relative fat-free mass adaptations\", \"significantly increased\", \"whey proteins may increase abdominal fat loss and relative fat-free mass adaptations in response to resistance training when compared to fast-acting carbohydrates.\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"post-exercise supplementation with whey proteins\", \"carbohydrates\", \"total and abdominal area fat\", \"significantly decreased\", \"the whey protein group reduced more total and abdominal area fat when compared to the carbohydrate group independent of the type of RT (P < 0.05).\"],\n    [\"post-exercise supplementation with whey proteins\", \"carbohydrates\", \"fat-free mass\", \"significantly increased\", \"a larger relative increase (per kg bodyweight) in fat-free mass was observed in the protein vs. carbohydrate group (P < 0.05) without significant differences to the combined group.\"],\n    [\"post-exercise supplementation with whey proteins\", \"carbohydrates or combination of proteins and carbohydrates\", \"muscle size or strength\", \"no significant difference\", \"Twelve-week RT led to increased fat-free mass, muscle size and strength independent of post-exercise nutrient intake (P < 0.05).\"],\n    [\"post-exercise supplementation with whey proteins\", \"null\", \"serum lipids\", \"no significant difference\", \"No systematic effects of the interventions were found for serum lipids.\"],\n    [\"post-exercise supplementation with whey proteins\", \"carbohydrates or combination of proteins and carbohydrates\", \"abdominal fat loss and relative fat-free mass adaptations\", \"significantly increased\", \"whey proteins may increase abdominal fat loss and relative fat-free mass adaptations in response to resistance training when compared to fast-acting carbohydrates.\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "45ac981a7ca9d7335860b11ad909fc969ed9d50c061a2ab2d4200680bcded690", "prompt_hash": "e225781e9606177632748baaa3de63cff94406f7a74089b5302578b18c296177", "target_hash": "5dcc9903013e8a8b4914bf2db8d30fd8fab13938f1934c47b5ca7d2d3cfde0f6", "bypass": null}

Group A received (inj.) fentanyl (2 μg/kg), followed 3 min later by inj. propofol at the rate of 30 mg/kg/hr infusion till the loss of response to verbal command while group B received inj. fentanyl (2 μg/kg), followed 3 min later by inj. propofol at the rate of 30 mg/kg/hr infusion. The end point of hypnosis was when the BIS value was sustained for 1 min at 48±2. The patients were intubated. Total induction dose of propofol was noted in each group. The value of BIS and hemodynamic parameters (heart rate, systolic/diastolic blood pressure) were noted at the time of loss of consciousness, at the time of intubation, and 1 min after intubation, thereafter every minute for first 10 min and thereafter every 10 min till end of surgery.

The dosage used in group B were less but not clinically significant (P=0.575).

Here, a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study examined the effect of olanzapine (an atypical antipsychotic) augmentation therapy on sleep architecture, specifically slow wave sleep (SWS), in the treatment of depression. The effect of olanzapine augmentation therapy on other features of sleep (e.g., sleep continuity) and depression (e.g., illness severity and cognitive function) were also determined.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Patients currently experiencing a major depressive episode and who were on a stable medication were included. Sleep architecture was measured by overnight ambulatory polysomnography. Illness severity was determined using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Cognitive function was examined using Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB): Spatial Working Memory (SWM), Spatial Span (SSP), and Reaction Time (RTI) tasks. Polysomnographs, clinical measures and cognitive tests were administered at baseline, after 2–4 days of treatment and after 28–31 days of treatment. Twenty-five patients participated in the study (N = 10, N = 15 for placebo and olanzapine treated groups respectively).\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The primary objective of the study was to assess the objective (polysomnographic) changes in sleep quality, defined as changes in SWS, following olanzapine treatment for depression. Latency to but not duration of SWS was found to significantly differ between olanzapine- and placebo-treated participants (Hedge's g: 0.97, 0.13 respectively). A significant improvement in olanzapine-treated participants over placebo-treated participants was observed in secondary outcome measures, including sleep efficiency, total sleep time, and sleep latency. Secondary objectives assessed the subjective changes in sleep quality parameters and correlated them with measures of illness severity and changes in cognition. MADRS scores were significantly improved in olanzapine-treated participants over time but not more than placebo treatment. There was no significant difference between olanzapine- and placebo-treated participants in SWM, SSP or RTI tasks.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine augmentation treatment generally did not improve SWS but did improve sleep continuity and depression. Olanzapine may be one of few medications that improve sleep continuity, thus directly targeting symptoms of depression.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov,\nNCT00520507.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"olanzapine\", \"placebo\", \"sleep efficiency \", \"significantly increased\", \"A significant improvement in olanzapine-treated participants over placebo-treated participants was observed in secondary outcome measures, including sleep efficiency, total sleep time, and sleep latency.\"], [\"olanzapine\", \"placebo\", \"Spatial Working Memory (SWM), Spatial Span (SSP), and Reaction Time (RTI) tasks\", \"no significant difference\", \"There was no significant difference between olanzapine- and placebo-treated participants in SWM, SSP or RTI tasks.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Combination therapy can both improve treatment and provide important public health benefits if it curbs the spread of parasites harbouring resistance genes. Thus, drug combinations must be identified which minimise gametocyte emergence in treated cases, and so prevent selective transmission of parasites resistant to any of the partner drugs.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS AND FINDINGS: In a randomised controlled trial, 497 children with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were treated with CQ and SP (three doses and one dose respectively; n = 91), or six doses of artemether in fixed combination with lumefantrine (co-artemether [Coartem, Riamet]) (n = 406). Carriage rates of Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes and trophozoites were measured 7, 14, and 28 d after treatment. The infectiousness of venous blood from 29 children carrying P. falciparum gametocytes 7 d after treatment was tested by membrane-feeding of Anopheles mosquitoes. <p> Children treated with co-artemether were significantly less likely to carry gametocytes within the 4 weeks following treatment than those receiving CQ/SP (30 of 378 [7.94%] versus 42 of 86 [48.8%]; p < 0.0001). Carriers in the co-artemether group harboured gametocytes at significantly lower densities, for shorter periods (0.3 d versus 4.2 d; p < 0.0001) and were less infectious to mosquitoes at day 7 (p < 0.001) than carriers who had received CQ/SP.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Co-artemether is highly effective at preventing post-treatment transmission of P. falciparum. Our results suggest that co-artemether has specific activity against immature sequestered gametocytes, and has the capacity to minimise transmission of drug-resistant parasites.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"chloroquine (CQ) and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP)\", \"artemether in fixed combination with lumefantrine\", \"carring gametocytes within the 4 weeks following treatment\", \"significantly increased\", \"Children treated with co-artemether were significantly less likely to carry gametocytes within the 4 weeks following treatment than those receiving CQ/SP (30 of 378 [7.94%] versus 42 of 86 [48.8%];

Branded drug websites often capitalize on the multimedia capabilities of the Internet by using videos to emphasize drug benefits and characteristics. However, it is unknown how such videos affect consumer processing of drug information.\n\nABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine how videos on prescription drug websites, and the inclusion of risk information in those videos, influence consumer knowledge and perceptions.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: We conducted an experimental study in which online panel participants with acid reflux (n=1070) or high blood pressure (n=1055) were randomly assigned to view 1 of the 10 fictitious prescription drug websites and complete a short questionnaire. On each website, we manipulated the type of video (patient testimonial, mechanism of action animation, or none) and whether the video mentioned drug risks.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Participants who viewed any video were less likely to recognize drug risks presented only in the website text (P≤.01). Including risk information in videos increased participants' recognition of the risks presented in the videos (P≤.01). However, in some cases, including risk information in videos decreased participants' recognition of the risks not presented in the videos (ie, risks presented in text only; P≤.04). Participants who viewed a video without drug risk information thought that the website placed more emphasis on benefits, compared with participants who viewed the video with drug risk information (P≤.01). Compared with participants who viewed a video without drug risk information, participants who viewed a video with drug risk information thought that the drug was less effective in the high blood pressure sample (P=.03) and thought that risks were more serious in the acid reflux sample (P=.01). There were no significant differences between risk and nonrisk video conditions on other perception measures (P>.05). In addition, we noted a few differences among the types of videos.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Including risks in branded drug website videos may increase in-video risk retention at the expense of text-only risk retention.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"websites presented a video of a personal testimonial, an informational mechanism of action- video  viewed a video without drug risk information\", \" viewed the video with drug risk information \", \"emphasis on benefits\", \"significantly increased\", \"Participants who viewed a video without drug risk information thought that the website placed more emphasis on benefits, compared with participants who viewed the video with drug risk information (P\\u2264.01).\"], [\"websites presented a video of a personal testimonial, an informational mechanism of action- video  viewed a video without drug risk information\", \" viewed the video with drug risk information \", \"patients thought that the drug was less effective in the high blood pressure sample\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Compared with participants who viewed a video without drug risk information, participants who viewed a video with drug risk information thought that the drug was less effective in the high blood pressure sample (P=.03)\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Combination therapy can both improve treatment and provide important public health benefits if it curbs the spread of parasites harbouring resistance genes. Thus, drug combinations must be identified which minimise gametocyte emergence in treated cases, and so prevent selective transmission of parasites resistant to any of the partner drugs.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS AND FINDINGS: In a randomised controlled trial, 497 children with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were treated with CQ and SP (three doses and one dose respectively; n = 91), or six doses of artemether in fixed combination with lumefantrine (co-artemether [Coartem, Riamet]) (n = 406). Carriage rates of Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes and trophozoites were measured 7, 14, and 28 d after treatment. The infectiousness of venous blood from 29 children carrying P. falciparum gametocytes 7 d after treatment was tested by membrane-feeding of Anopheles mosquitoes. <p> Children treated with co-artemether were significantly less likely to carry gametocytes within the 4 weeks following treatment than those receiving CQ/SP (30 of 378 [7.94%] versus 42 of 86 [48.8%]; p < 0.0001). Carriers in the co-artemether group harboured gametocytes at significantly lower densities, for shorter periods (0.3 d versus 4.2 d; p < 0.0001) and were less infectious to mosquitoes at day 7 (p < 0.001) than carriers who had received CQ/SP.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Co-artemether is highly effective at preventing post-treatment transmission of P. falciparum. Our results suggest that co-artemether has specific activity against immature sequestered gametocytes, and has the capacity to minimise transmission of drug-resistant parasites.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"co-artemether\", \"CQ and SP\", \"carriage rates of Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Children treated with co-artemether were significantly less likely to carry gametocytes within the 4 weeks following treatment than those receiving CQ/SP (30 of 378 [7.94%] versus 42 of 86 [48.8%]; p < 0.0001).\"],\n    [\"co-artemether\", \"CQ and SP\", \"densities of gametocytes\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Carriers in the co-artemether group harboured gametocytes at significantly lower densities, for shorter periods (0.3 d versus 4.2 d; p < 0.0001) than carriers who had received CQ/SP.\"],\n    [\"co-artemether\", \"CQ and SP\", \"infectiousness to mosquitoes at day 7\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Carriers in the co-artemether group were less infectious to mosquitoes at day 7 (p < 0.001) than carriers who had received CQ/SP.\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"co-artemether\", \"CQ and SP\", \"carriage rates of Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Children treated with co-artemether were significantly less likely to carry gametocytes within the 4 weeks following treatment than those receiving CQ/SP (30 of 378 [7.94%] versus 42 of 86 [48.8%]; p < 0.0001).\"],\n    [\"co-artemether\", \"CQ and SP\", \"densities of gametocytes\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Carriers in the co-artemether group harboured gametocytes at significantly lower densities, for shorter periods (0.3 d versus 4.2 d; p < 0.0001) than carriers who had received CQ/SP.\"],\n    [\"co-artemether\", \"CQ and SP\", \"infectiousness to mosquitoes at day 7\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Carriers in the co-artemether group were less infectious to mosquitoes at day 7 (p < 0.001) than carriers who had received CQ/SP.\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "ae081855372c87039d560742d6bc0146fd27fe62a805567a8503607831ee3dbd", "prompt_hash": "7d422e6bbe93777ab39fe806e1e0c3e99fbdc78a240f4e6cc67bf15e8aa18854", "target_hash": "e1b641dda9efde67f46dcc119dc65393c4a95c643d2840a8d96e1464597b7698", "bypass": null}

Over-the-counter treatment options known to reduce pain and inflammation, such as oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), may be associated with systemic side effects (e.g. gastrointestinal), while topically applied rubefacients are frequently ineffective, despite their popularity. DSG 1%, which has been clinically proven to be effective and well-tolerated for the treatment of osteoarthritis, could be a new option for the treatment of acute injuries, such as ankle sprains. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of DSG 1% applied q.i.d in subjects with acute ankle sprain.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS:: In a double-blind, multicenter study, 205 subjects with acute sprain of the lateral ankle (Grade l-ll) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to DSG 1% (n=102) or placebo (n=103) applied q.i.d for 7 days. The primary efficacy outcome was pain-on-movement (POM) at 72 hours, assessed on a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary efficacy outcomes included ankle swelling assessed by circumference measurement compared with the non-affected ankle, tenderness measured by pressure algometry compared with the non-affected ankle, and ankle joint function assessed by the Karlsson scoring scale. Efficacy assessments were conducted at clinic visits at 12, 24, and 72 hours and 7 days after treatment initiation. All adverse events were recorded and blood samples were collected for laboratory safety analysis.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: DSG 1% treatment resulted in a significant decrease of POM mean scores when compared with placebo (57 mm vs. 21 mm respectively; p<0.0001). DSG 1% treatment also resulted in significantly greater reductions in ankle swelling than placebo. The difference in circumference between the injured and non-affected ankles for subjects treated with DSG 1% vs. placebo was 1.9 cm vs. 2.4 cm at 12 hours, 1.4 cm vs. 2.0 cm at 24 hours, 0.8 cm vs. 1.5 cm at 72 hours, and 0.2 cm vs. 0.8 cm at 7 days (p<0.0001 at all time points). In subjects treated with DSG 1%, the mean difference in tenderness between the injured and non-affected ankles decreased more rapidly than in subjects in the placebo group at 12 hours (-24.7 N/cm2 vs. -28.5 N/cm2), 24 hours (-17.8 N/cm2 vs. -25.3 N/cm2), 72 hours (-9.7 N/cm2 vs. -19.8 N/cm2), and 7 days (-2.6 N/cm2 vs. -12.1 N/cm2) (p<0.0001 at all time points). In subjects treated with DSG 1%, the mean total ankle joint function score was 24.5 at baseline vs. 25.3 for the placebo group. At 72 hours and Day 7, mean ankle joint function scores were 56.3 and 79.7, respectively, for the DSG 1% group vs. 35.6 and 47.0, respectively, for the placebo group. The differences between treatment groups were significant at all time points (p<0.0001). The safety profile of DSG 1% was similar to that of placebo.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: DSG 1% applied 4 times daily was significantly superior to placebo in reducing pain, swelling and tenderness and improving ankle joint function in subjects with acute ankle sprain.

The objective of this study was to examine whether implementation of a standardized emergency department (ED) protocol improves the quality of syncope evaluation.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a prospective, non-randomized study conducted at a 1900-bed, tertiary teaching hospital in South Korea. We compared two specific periods, including a 12-month observation period (control group, January-December 2009) and a 10-month intervention period after the implementation of standardized approaches, comprising risk stratification, hospital order sets and establishment of a syncope observational unit (intervention group, March-December 2010). Primary end points were hospital admission rates and medical costs related to syncope evaluation.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: A total of 244 patients were enrolled in this study (116 patients in the control group and 128 patients in the intervention group). The admission rate decreased by 8.3% in the intervention group (adjusted odds ratio 0.31, 95% confidence interval 0.13-0.70, p=0.005). There was a cost reduction of about 30% during the intervention period [369000 Korean won (KRW), interquartile range (IQR) 240000-602000 KRW], compared with the control period (542000 KRW, IQR 316000-1185000 KRW). The length of stay in the ED was also reduced in the intervention group (median: 4.6 hours vs. 3.4 hours).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Standardized approaches to syncope evaluation reduced hospital admissions, medical costs and length of stay in the overcrowded emergency department of a tertiary teaching hospital in South Korea.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Educational program and ED protocol for syncope evaluation\", \"No standardized guidelines or educational programs\", \"Admission rate\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The admission rate decreased by 8.3% in the intervention group (adjusted odds ratio 0.31, 95% confidence interval 0.13-0.70, p=0.005).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Over-the-counter treatment options known to reduce pain and inflammation, such as oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), may be associated with systemic side effects (e.g. gastrointestinal), while topically applied rubefacients are frequently ineffective, despite their popularity. DSG 1%, which has been clinically proven to be effective and well-tolerated for the treatment of osteoarthritis, could be a new option for the treatment of acute injuries, such as ankle sprains. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of DSG 1% applied q.i.d in subjects with acute ankle sprain.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS:: In a double-blind, multicenter study, 205 subjects with acute sprain of the lateral ankle (Grade l-ll) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to DSG 1% (n=102) or placebo (n=103) applied q.i.d for 7 days. The primary efficacy outcome was pain-on-movement (POM) at 72 hours, assessed on a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary efficacy outcomes included ankle swelling assessed by circumference measurement compared with the non-affected ankle, tenderness measured by pressure algometry compared with the non-affected ankle, and ankle joint function assessed by the Karlsson scoring scale. Efficacy assessments were conducted at clinic visits at 12, 24, and 72 hours and 7 days after treatment initiation. All adverse events were recorded and blood samples were collected for laboratory safety analysis.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: DSG 1% treatment resulted in a significant decrease of POM mean scores when compared with placebo (57 mm vs. 21 mm respectively; p<0.0001). DSG 1% treatment also resulted in significantly greater reductions in ankle swelling than placebo. The difference in circumference between the injured and non-affected ankles for subjects treated with DSG 1% vs. placebo was 1.9 cm vs. 2.4 cm at 12 hours, 1.4 cm vs. 2.0 cm at 24 hours, 0.8 cm vs. 1.5 cm at 72 hours, and 0.2 cm vs. 0.8 cm at 7 days (p<0.0001 at all time points). In subjects treated with DSG 1%, the mean difference in tenderness between the injured and non-affected ankles decreased more rapidly than in subjects in the placebo group at 12 hours (-24.7 N/cm2 vs. -28.5 N/cm2), 24 hours (-17.8 N/cm2 vs. -25.3 N/cm2), 72 hours (-9.7 N/cm2 vs. -19.8 N/cm2), and 7 days (-2.6 N/cm2 vs. -12.1 N/cm2) (p<0.0001 at all time points). In subjects treated with DSG 1%, the mean total ankle joint function score was 24.5 at baseline vs. 25.3 for the placebo group. At 72 hours and Day 7, mean ankle joint function scores were 56.3 and 79.7, respectively, for the DSG 1% group vs. 35.6 and 47.0, respectively, for the placebo group. The differences between treatment groups were significant at all time points (p<0.0001). The safety profile of DSG 1% was similar to that of placebo.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: DSG 1% applied 4 times daily was significantly superior to placebo in reducing pain, swelling and tenderness and improving ankle joint function in subjects with acute ankle sprain. Overall, DSG 1% was well tolerated both systemically and locally.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"DSG 1% applied q.i.d\", \"placebo\", \"pain-on-movement (POM) at 72 hours\", \"significantly decreased\", \"DSG 1% treatment resulted in a significant decrease of POM mean scores when compared with placebo (57 mm vs. 21 mm respectively; p<0.0001).\"],\n    [\"DSG 1% applied q.i.d\", \"placebo\", \"ankle swelling\", \"significantly decreased\", \"DSG 1% treatment also resulted in significantly greater reductions in ankle swelling than placebo.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the different pre-treatments (ethanol, ethylene de amine tetra acetic acid [EDTA] and EDTA + ethanol) on the bond strength of adhesively lutted tooth colored fiber post.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:: Forty-eight human anterior teeth (incisor and canine) were selected in this experimental study. The species were endodontically treated, and the post-space was prepared. The species were randomly divided into four groups of 12 teeth in each and were treated as follows: (i) 0.1 M EDTA, (ii) 99.6% ethanol, (iii) 0.1 M EDTA followed by 99.6% ethanol and (iv) without any treatment (control). A push-out test was carried out after 24 h. Each tooth was cut into three 1 mm-thick sections. Fracture type was assessed using stereomicroscope. The data were analyzed by one way-ANOVA followed by Scheffe post-hoc test at P = 0.05.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: Almost, in EDTA and (EDTA + ethanol) every sample failed at the interface between post and lutting cement. Predominant failure mode in ethanol and control group was mixed failure. The surface treatment methods did not have any significant effect (P > 0.05) on any group but EDTA group had the highest bond strength.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: Surface treatment with (ethanol, EDTA, and EDTA + ethanol) does not significantly appear to be effective in improving the bond strength of fiber posts into root dentine.

GDM patients were randomised to 2 groups per target glycaemic levels: GDM1 (tight glycaemic targets, fasting blood glucose < 5.1 mmol/L and <7.0 mmol/L postprandial, N = 20) and GDM2 (less tight glycaemic targets, <5.3 mmol/L and < 7.8 mmol/L, respectively, N = 21). The control group included 25 women with normal glucose tolerance. ANGPTL4 expression was decreased in the HUVECs from GDM patients versus the control group (23.11 ± 5.71, 21.47 ± 5.64, and 98.33 ± 20.92, for GDM1, GDM2, and controls; p < 0.001) with no difference between GDM1 and GDM2. The level of adiponectin gene expression was low and did not differ among the groups. Leptin gene expression was undetectable in HUVECs. In cord blood, leptin/adiponectin ratio (LAR) was increased in GDM2 compared to controls and GDM1 (p = 0.038) and did not differ between GDM1 and controls. Tight glycaemic targets were associated with normalisation of increased LAR in the cord blood.

Since these reductions may lead to dangerous complications, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of vasopressors and isotonic fluids on hemodynamic status of cardiac surgery patients during their transfer to ICU.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: This randomized single-blind clinical trial was conducted in Chamran Hospital (Isfahan, Iran). A total number of 75 consecutive patients undergoing planned first-time coronary artery bypass grafting entered our study. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), CVP, and pulse rate (PR) were recorded at 5 to 10 minutes before leaving operating room and immediately after hospitalization in the ICU. Subjects in the first group received 7 cc/kg intravenous normal saline (as an isotonic fluid) within 5-10 minutes. The second group received 10 mg ephedrine before being transferred to the ICU.\n\nABSTRACT. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 61.0 ± 3.6 years. No significant change in PR was detected in normal saline group (P > 0.05). No significant differences were found in two groups in SBP before and after hospitalization in the ICU (P > 0.05). DBP and CVP had statistically significant reductions in both groups after hospitalization in the ICU (P < 0.001). The mean CVP was also reduced significantly (10.7 ± 2.9 vs. 8.2 ± 3.4; P < 0.001).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Significant reductions in mean values of DBP and CVP occur during cardiac surgery and after arrival to the ICU. These reductions cannot be prevented by administration of vasopressors, such as ephedrine, or infusion of isotonic fluids, such as normal saline. Further studies are required to assess whether more fluids, other types of fluids, or other drugs can stop this phenomenon.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Ephedrine\", \"Control (nothing)\", \"Systolic blood preasure\", \"no significant difference\", \"No significant differences were found in two groups in SBP before and after hospitalization in the ICU (P \\u003e 0.05)\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

GDM patients were randomised to 2 groups per target glycaemic levels: GDM1 (tight glycaemic targets, fasting blood glucose < 5.1 mmol/L and <7.0 mmol/L postprandial, N = 20) and GDM2 (less tight glycaemic targets, <5.3 mmol/L and < 7.8 mmol/L, respectively, N = 21). The control group included 25 women with normal glucose tolerance. ANGPTL4 expression was decreased in the HUVECs from GDM patients versus the control group (23.11 ± 5.71, 21.47 ± 5.64, and 98.33 ± 20.92, for GDM1, GDM2, and controls; p < 0.001) with no difference between GDM1 and GDM2. The level of adiponectin gene expression was low and did not differ among the groups. Leptin gene expression was undetectable in HUVECs. In cord blood, leptin/adiponectin ratio (LAR) was increased in GDM2 compared to controls and GDM1 (p = 0.038) and did not differ between GDM1 and controls. Tight glycaemic targets were associated with normalisation of increased LAR in the cord blood. ANGPTL4 expression was downregulated in HUVECs of newborns from GDM mothers and was not affected by the intensity of glycaemic control.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"ANGPTL4 expression\", \"Control group\", \"ANGPTL4 expression in HUVECs\", \"significantly decreased\", \"ANGPTL4 expression was decreased in the HUVECs from GDM patients versus the control group (23.11 ± 5.71, 21.47 ± 5.64, and 98.33 ± 20.92, for GDM1, GDM2, and controls; p < 0.001) with no difference between GDM1 and GDM2.\"],\n    [null, \"GDM1\", \"Leptin/adiponectin ratio (LAR)\", \"no significant difference\", \"Leptin gene expression was undetectable in HUVECs.

The proportion of affected patients, the optimum follow-up period and whether there are differences between drugs in the development of this complication remain to be ascertained.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, phase IV, controlled, crossover study we recruited 30 patients with stage 3 CKD under restrictive eligibility criteria and strict dietary control. With the exception of withdrawals, each patient was treated with olmesartan and enalapril separately for 3 months each, with a 1-week wash-out period between treatments. Patients were clinically assessed on 10 occasions via measurements of serum and urine samples. We used the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel statistics for comparison of categorical data between groups. Comparisons were also made using independent two-sample t-tests and Welch's t-test. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed when necessary. We used either a Mann–Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis test if the distribution was not normal or the variance not homogeneous.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Enalapril and olmesartan increased serum potassium levels similarly (0.3 mmol/L and 0.24 mmol/L respectively). The percentage of patients presenting hyperkalemia higher than 5 mmol/L did not differ between treatments: 37% for olmesartan and 40% for enalapril. The mean e-GFR ranged 46.3 to 48.59 ml/mint/1.73 m2 in those treated with olmesartan and 46.8 to 48.3 ml/mint/1.73 m2 in those with enalapril and remained unchanged at the end of the study. The decreases in microalbuminuria were also similar (23% in olmesartan and 29% in enalapril patients) in the 4 weeks time point. The percentage of patients presenting hyperkalemia, even after a two month period, did not differ between treatments. There were no appreciable changes in sodium and potassium urinary excretion.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Disturbances in potassium balance upon treatment with either olmesartan or enalapril are frequent and without differences between groups. The follow-up of these patients should include control of potassium levels, at least after the first week and the first and second month after initiating treatment.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial EudraCT \"2008-002191-98\".\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Enalapril\", \"Olmesartan\", \"Glomerular filtration rate increase \", \"no significant difference\", \"The mean e-GFR ranged 46.3 to 48.59 ml/mint/1.73 m2 in those treated with olmesartan and 46.8 to 48.3 ml/mint/1.73 m2 in those with enalapril and remained unchanged at the end of the study.\"], [\"Enalapril\", \"Olmesartan\", \"Microalbuminuria decrease\", \"no significant difference\", \"The decreases in microalbuminuria were also similar (23% in olmesartan and 29% in enalapril patients) in the 4 weeks time point.\"], [\"Enalapril\", \"Olmesartan\", \"Hyperkalemia higher than 5 mmol/L\", \"no significant difference\", \"The percentage of patients presenting hyperkalemia higher than 5 mmol/L did not differ between treatments: 37% for olmesartan and 40% for enalapril.\"], [\"Enalapril\", \"Olmesartan\", \"Urinary potassium\", \"no significant difference\", \"There were no appreciable changes in sodium and potassium urinary excretion.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

As new guidelines in this context, particularly for health care-associated (HCA) infections, would be needed, we performed a trial documenting whether an empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is more effective than the standard one for these infections. Because of the higher daily cost of broad-spectrum than standard antibiotics, we performed a cost analysis to compare: 1) total drug costs, 2) profitability of hospital admissions.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: This retrospective observational analysis was performed on patients enrolled in the trial NCT01820026, in which consecutive cirrhotic patients with HCA infections were randomly assigned to a standard vs a broad-spectrum treatment. Antibiotic daily doses, days of treatment, length of hospital stay, and DRG (diagnosis-related group) were recorded from the clinical trial medical records. The profitability of hospitalizations was calculated considering DRG tariffs divided by length of hospital stay.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: We considered 84 patients (42 for each group). The standard therapy allowed to obtain a first-line treatment cost lower than in the broad-spectrum therapy. Anyway, the latter, being related to a lower failure rate (19% vs 57.1%), resulted in cost saving in terms of cumulative antibiotic costs (first- and second-line treatments). The mean cost saving per patient for the broad-spectrum arm was €44.18 (−37.6%), with a total cost saving of about €2,000. Compared to standard group, we observed a statistically significant reduction in hospital stay from 17.8 to 11.8 days (p<0.002) for patients treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The distribution of DRG tariffs was similar in the two groups. According to DRG, the shorter length of hospital stay of the broad-spectrum group involved a higher mean profitable daily cost than standard group (€345.61 vs €252.23; +37%).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Our study supports the idea that the use of a broad-spectrum empirical treatment for HCA infections in cirrhosis would be cost-saving and that hospitals need to be aware of the clinical and economic consequences of a wrong antibiotic treatment in this setting.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"broad-spectrum treatment\", \"standard\", \"hospital stay\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Compared to standard group, we observed a statistically significant reduction in hospital stay from 17.8 to 11.8 days (p\\u0026lt;0.002) for patients treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.\"], [\"broad-spectrum treatment\", \"standard\", \"hospital stay\", \"significantly decreased\", \"statistically significant reduction in hospital stay from 17.8 to 11.8 days (p\\u003c0.002) for patients treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:225"}, "target": "[[\"broad-spectrum treatment\", \"standard\", \"hospital stay\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Compared to standard group, we observed a statistically significant reduction in hospital stay from 17.8 to 11.8 days (p\\u0026lt;0.002) for patients treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.\"], [\"broad-spectrum treatment\", \"standard\", \"hospital stay\", \"significantly decreased\", \"statistically significant reduction in hospital stay from 17.8 to 11.8 days (p\\u003c0.002) for patients treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

Oral hygiene practices among visually impaired children require a special approach with time and patience. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of oral health education and fluoridated dentifrices on the oral health status of visually impaired children.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:: Fifty visually impaired children between 8 and 12 years of age formed the study group. Oral health education and motivation was done with the help of Braille. Modified Bass method of brushing was taught to the children and the required dental treatment was done. Subjects were randomly divided into two equal groups fluoridated and non-fluoridated. Oral hygiene index -simplified, DMFT, deft index, and Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus count were assessed at baseline, immediately after the treatment and at 3, 6, and 12 month intervals. The oral health awareness was assessed using a questionnaire at the beginning and end of the study.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: At baseline, the mean OHI-S, DMFT and deft scores were 2.72, 0.47, and 0.51 respectively. At the end of 12 months there was a significant decrease in OHI-S scores in the fluoridated group. No significant difference was seen in DMFT and deft between the fluoridated and non-fluoridated groups at the different time interval. After the oral health education and comprehensive treatment there was a reduction in Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus counts in both groups; however, at the end of 3, 6, 12 months there was a significant decrease in fluoridated group as compared to the non-fluoridated. The oral health awareness increased significantly at the end of the study.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: The oral health education and motivation formulated for the visually impaired children was effective in improving their oral health status. Fluoridated dentifrices decreased the Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus counts and improved the oral hygiene status.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"fluoridated dentifrices\", \"non-fluoridated dentifrices\", \"mean DMFT and deft\", \"no significant difference\", \"No significant difference was seen in DMFT and deft between the fluoridated and non-fluoridated groups\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

As new guidelines in this context, particularly for health care-associated (HCA) infections, would be needed, we performed a trial documenting whether an empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is more effective than the standard one for these infections. Because of the higher daily cost of broad-spectrum than standard antibiotics, we performed a cost analysis to compare: 1) total drug costs, 2) profitability of hospital admissions.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: This retrospective observational analysis was performed on patients enrolled in the trial NCT01820026, in which consecutive cirrhotic patients with HCA infections were randomly assigned to a standard vs a broad-spectrum treatment. Antibiotic daily doses, days of treatment, length of hospital stay, and DRG (diagnosis-related group) were recorded from the clinical trial medical records. The profitability of hospitalizations was calculated considering DRG tariffs divided by length of hospital stay.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: We considered 84 patients (42 for each group). The standard therapy allowed to obtain a first-line treatment cost lower than in the broad-spectrum therapy. Anyway, the latter, being related to a lower failure rate (19% vs 57.1%), resulted in cost saving in terms of cumulative antibiotic costs (first- and second-line treatments). The mean cost saving per patient for the broad-spectrum arm was €44.18 (−37.6%), with a total cost saving of about €2,000. Compared to standard group, we observed a statistically significant reduction in hospital stay from 17.8 to 11.8 days (p<0.002) for patients treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The distribution of DRG tariffs was similar in the two groups. According to DRG, the shorter length of hospital stay of the broad-spectrum group involved a higher mean profitable daily cost than standard group (€345.61 vs €252.23; +37%).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Our study supports the idea that the use of a broad-spectrum empirical treatment for HCA infections in cirrhosis would be cost-saving and that hospitals need to be aware of the clinical and economic consequences of a wrong antibiotic treatment in this setting.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"broad-spectrum antibiotics\", \"standard antibiotics\", \"hospital stay\", \"significantly decreased\", \"we observed a statistically significant reduction in hospital stay from 17.8 to 11.8 days (p<0.002) for patients treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.\"],\n    [\"broad-spectrum antibiotics\", \"standard antibiotics\", \"mean profitable daily cost\", \"significantly increased\", \"the shorter length of hospital stay of the broad-spectrum group involved a higher mean profitable daily cost than standard group (€345.61 vs €252.23; +37%)\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"broad-spectrum antibiotics\", \"standard antibiotics\", \"hospital stay\", \"significantly decreased\", \"we observed a statistically significant reduction in hospital stay from 17.8 to 11.8 days (p<0.002) for patients treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.\"],\n    [\"broad-spectrum antibiotics\", \"standard antibiotics\", \"mean profitable daily cost\", \"significantly increased\", \"the shorter length of hospital stay of the broad-spectrum group involved a higher mean profitable daily cost than standard group (€345.61 vs €252.23; +37%)\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "cf0ddf857982ad235e0a9523d2785005aa278e6847965e7985650e434fa1612c", "prompt_hash": "a6f366bfdb1d5ec14ea95d42b3f6147e61c1544f6ae8a5715d5f69604eca14db", "target_hash": "9f590a9742be783682845382a5c808f9878568a514cd5d6bcfdf3f1750a58b34", "bypass": null}

However, there is limited research on chronic alcohol consumption with Helicobacter pylori infection. We sought to investigate the relationship between the cytokine profile, oxidative balance and H. pylori infection in subjects with chronic alcohol consumption. A total of 142 subjects were divided into three groups: 59 subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion and H. pylori infection (group A); 53 subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion without H. pylori infection (group B); and 30 control subjects (group C). The serum levels of CagA, interleukin (IL)-10, E-selectin, TNF-α, malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found that the ages and serum H. pylori CagA levels among the three groups, as well as both the mean drinking age and the mean daily alcohol consumption between groups A and B, were matched and comparable. Comparing the BMIs among the three groups, the BMI differences were found to be statistically significant (F=3.921, P<0.05). Compared with group C, the BMIs in groups A and B were significantly higher (P<0.001 and P<0.01, respectively); however, the BMI differences between group A and group B were not statistically significant (P>0.05). Additionally, no differences in the serum CagA levels were found in comparisons among the groups (all P>0.05). The serum IL-10 and E-selectin levels in group A were significantly lower than those in group B (serum IL-10: P<0.05; E-selectin: P<0.05). The serum IL-10 in group A was significantly higher than that in group C (P<0.01); the serum E-selectin levels in group A did not significantly differ compared with those in group C (P>0.05). Furthermore, the serum IL-10 and E-selectin levels in group B were significantly higher than those in group C (serum IL-10: P<0.001; E-selectin: P<0.05); however, the serum TNF-α levels did not differ among groups (all P>0.05). Although the serum levels of MDA and SOD in groups A and B were slightly lower than those in group C, there were no significant differences among groups (all P>0.05). In conclusion, we believe that H. pylori infection might cause a significant inhibition of certain cytokine profiles in subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion. Moreover, chronically ingested alcohol may exert an adjusted inflammatory effect, but there was no association between H. pylori infection, chronic alcohol consumption and oxidative balance.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Alcohol consumption \", \"Control\", \"TNF-\\u03b1 \", \"no significant difference\", \"the serum TNF-\\u03b1 levels did not differ among groups (all P\\u003e0.05).\"], [\"Alcohol consumption + H. pylori \", \"Alcohol consumption\", \"E-selectin\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The serum IL-10 and E-selectin levels in group A were significantly lower than those in group B (serum IL-10: P\\u003c0.05; E-selectin: P\\u003c0.05).\"], [\"Alcohol consumption + H. pylori \", \"Control\", \"E-selectin\", \"no significant difference\", \"The serum IL-10 in group A was significantly higher than that in group C (P\\u003c0.01); the serum E-selectin levels in group A did not significantly differ compared with those in group C (P\\u003e0.05).\"], [\"Alcohol consumption \", \"Control\", \"E-selectin\", \"significantly increased\", \"Furthermore, the serum IL-10 and E-selectin levels in group B were significantly higher than those in group C (serum IL-10: P\\u003c0.001; E-selectin: P\\u003c0.05);\"], [\"Alcohol consumption + H. pylori \", \"Alcohol consumption\", \"IL-10\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The serum IL-10 and E-selectin levels in group A were significantly lower than those in group B (serum IL-10: P\\u003c0.05; E-selectin: P\\u003c0.05).\"], [\"Alcohol consumption + H. pylori \", \"Control\", \"IL-10\", \"significantly increased\", \"The serum IL-10 in group A was significantly higher than that in group C (P\\u003c0.01);\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

The primary end point was trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) at Week 26. Other key end points included peak FEV1, area under the curve for FEV1 from 5 minutes to 4 hours (FEV1 AUC5 min–4 h), Transition Dyspnea Index focal score, St George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score, and safety. Here, we present efficacy and safety of IND/GLY in the Japanese subgroup.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Of 2,144 patients from the SHINE study, 182 (8.5%) were Japanese and randomized to IND/GLY (n=42), IND (n=41), GLY (n=40), TIO (n=40), or placebo (n=19). Improvement in trough FEV1 from baseline was 190 mL with IND/GLY and treatment differences versus IND (90 mL), GLY (100 mL), TIO (90 mL), and placebo (280 mL) along with a rapid onset of action at Week 26. IND/GLY showed an improvement in FEV1 AUC5 min–4 h versus all comparators (all P<0.05). All the treatments were well tolerated and showed comparable effect on Transition Dyspnea Index focal score and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score. The effect of IND/GLY in the Japanese subgroup was consistent to overall SHINE study population.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: IND/GLY demonstrated superior efficacy and comparable safety compared with its monocomponents, open-label TIO, and placebo and may be used as a treatment option for the management of moderate-to-severe COPD in Japanese patients.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"indacaterol (IND)/glycopyrronium (GLY) 110/50 \\u03bcg once daily\", \"GLY 50 \\u03bcg od, IND 150 \\u03bcg od, open-label tiotropium (TIO) 18 \\u03bcg od, and placebo\", \"forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)\", \"significantly increased\", \"IND/GLY showed an improvement in FEV1 AUC5 min\\u20134 h versus all comparators (all P\\u0026lt;0.05).\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:227"}, "target": "[[\"indacaterol (IND)/glycopyrronium (GLY) 110/50 \\u03bcg once daily\", \"GLY 50 \\u03bcg od, IND 150 \\u03bcg od, open-label tiotropium (TIO) 18 \\u03bcg od, and placebo\", \"forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)\", \"significantly increased\", \"IND/GLY showed an improvement in FEV1 AUC5 min\\u20134 h versus all comparators (all P\\u0026lt;0.05).\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

This study evaluates the impact of adding lobaplatin (L) to the TE regimen. Here, we show data from 125 patients (63 TE and 62 TEL patients). Four patients did not complete all the cycles. Two-sided P values show that the addition of L (38.7% vs. 12.7%, P = 0.001) significantly increases the rate of pCR in the breast and the axilla (TpCR) and the overall response rate (ORR; 93.5% vs. 73.0%, P = 0.003). The occurrence of grade 3–4 anemia and thrombocytopenia is higher in the TEL group (52.5% vs. 10.0% and 34.4% vs. 1.7% respectively). These results demonstrate that the addition of L to the TE regimen as neoadjuvant chemotherapy improves the TpCR and the ORR rates of TNBC but with increased side effects.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"  docetaxel (T) and epirubicin (E) +  lobaplatin (L)\", \" docetaxel (T) and epirubicin (E)\", \"Pathologic CR in the breast and the axilla (TpCR)\", \"significantly increased\", \"Two-sided P values show that the addition of L (38.7% vs. 12.7%, P\\u2009=\\u20090.001) significantly increases the rate of pCR in the breast and the axilla (TpCR) and the overall response rate (ORR; 93.5% vs. 73.0%, P\\u2009=\\u20090.003).\"], [\"  docetaxel (T) and epirubicin (E) +  lobaplatin (L)\", \" docetaxel (T) and epirubicin (E)\", \"grade 3\\u20134 thrombocytopenia and anemia\", \"significantly increased\", \"The occurrence of grade 3\\u20134 anemia and thrombocytopenia is higher in the TEL group (52.5% vs. 10.0% and 34.4% vs. 1.7% respectively).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

The primary end point was trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) at Week 26. Other key end points included peak FEV1, area under the curve for FEV1 from 5 minutes to 4 hours (FEV1 AUC5 min–4 h), Transition Dyspnea Index focal score, St George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score, and safety. Here, we present efficacy and safety of IND/GLY in the Japanese subgroup.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Of 2,144 patients from the SHINE study, 182 (8.5%) were Japanese and randomized to IND/GLY (n=42), IND (n=41), GLY (n=40), TIO (n=40), or placebo (n=19). Improvement in trough FEV1 from baseline was 190 mL with IND/GLY and treatment differences versus IND (90 mL), GLY (100 mL), TIO (90 mL), and placebo (280 mL) along with a rapid onset of action at Week 26. IND/GLY showed an improvement in FEV1 AUC5 min–4 h versus all comparators (all P<0.05). All the treatments were well tolerated and showed comparable effect on Transition Dyspnea Index focal score and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score. The effect of IND/GLY in the Japanese subgroup was consistent to overall SHINE study population.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: IND/GLY demonstrated superior efficacy and comparable safety compared with its monocomponents, open-label TIO, and placebo and may be used as a treatment option for the management of moderate-to-severe COPD in Japanese patients.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[[\"indacaterol (IND)/glycopyrronium (GLY) 110/50 μg once daily (od)\", \"GLY 50 μg od, IND 150 μg od, open-label tiotropium (TIO) 18 μg od, and placebo\", \"trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)\", \"significantly increased\", \"Improvement in trough FEV1 from baseline was 190 mL with IND/GLY and treatment differences versus IND (90 mL), GLY (100 mL), TIO (90 mL), and placebo (280 mL) along with a rapid onset of action at Week 26.\"], [\"indacaterol (IND)/glycopyrronium (GLY) 110/50 μg once daily (od)\", \"GLY 50 μg od, IND 150 μg od, open-label tiotropium (TIO) 18 μg od, and placebo\", \"FEV1 AUC5 min–4 h\", \"significantly increased\", \"IND/GLY showed an improvement in FEV1 AUC5 min–4 h versus all comparators (all P<0.05).\"]]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[[\"indacaterol (IND)/glycopyrronium (GLY) 110/50 μg once daily (od)\", \"GLY 50 μg od, IND 150 μg od, open-label tiotropium (TIO) 18 μg od, and placebo\", \"trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)\", \"significantly increased\", \"Improvement in trough FEV1 from baseline was 190 mL with IND/GLY and treatment differences versus IND (90 mL), GLY (100 mL), TIO (90 mL), and placebo (280 mL) along with a rapid onset of action at Week 26.\"], [\"indacaterol (IND)/glycopyrronium (GLY) 110/50 μg once daily (od)\", \"GLY 50 μg od, IND 150 μg od, open-label tiotropium (TIO) 18 μg od, and placebo\", \"FEV1 AUC5 min–4 h\", \"significantly increased\", \"IND/GLY showed an improvement in FEV1 AUC5 min–4 h versus all comparators (all P<0.05).\"]]"], "doc_hash": "3eb4aefb9f31d758ac449ac4043c406150fb8a0162af2c937717e35b17e23ea4", "prompt_hash": "57ffa2180f113b37f214f1390811985ade08547022c42850596557a8defd891b", "target_hash": "c59c1ba64149e7f7e284252cf24e74099d684a08e54138c723814f710173532f", "bypass": null}

This difference was entirely attributable to a difference between the two measures during the nocturnal period. Nocturnal gastric acid breakthrough was not a useful predictor of pathologic nocturnal esophageal reflux.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: In GERD subjects treated with a PPI, measuring time esophageal pH < 4 will significantly overestimate the prevalence of pathologic esophageal acid exposure over 24 hours and during the nocturnal period.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"integrated acidity\", \"time pH \\u003c 4\", \"the prevalence of pathologic 24-hour esophageal reflux\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The prevalence of pathologic 24-hour esophageal reflux in both studies was significantly higher when measured as time pH \\u003c 4 than when measured as integrated acidity\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

We tested the effectiveness of standardized education and telemonitoring for improving pain, distress, anxiety, depression, quality of life (QoL), and performance in outpatients with advanced cancers.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: A total of 108 patients were randomly assigned to receive pain education alone (control arm) or pain education plus telemonitoring (experimental arm). Nursing specialists provided video-assisted educational material in both arms and daily telemonitoring for the first week in the experimental arm. Assessment was performed at baseline and 1 week and included evaluations of pain (Brief Pain Inventory, BPI), distress (Distress Thermometer, DT), anxiety, and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS), QoL (QLQ-C30), and a Karnofsky score.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Overall (n = 108), pain intensity was significantly improved at 1 week, including worst pain (7.3 to 5.7, P < 0.01) and average pain (4.6 to 3.8, P < 0.01). Additionally, anxiety (HADS score ≥ 11, 75 % to 56 %, P < 0.01), depression (HADS score ≥ 11, 73 % to 51 %, P < 0.01), QoL (fatigue and insomnia), and the Karnofsky score (32 to 66, P < 0.01) were also significantly improved at 1 week. However, the level of distress did not improve. The telemonitoring plus standardized education group showed more significant improvement in portion of pain >4 on VAS scale (35 % vs. 19 %, P = 0.02).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Standardized pain education using nursing specialists is an efficient way to improve not only pain itself but also anxiety, depression, performance, and QoL.

Hence the use of balanced solutions could influence the inflammatory cascade triggered by the surgical procedures, the plasmatic electrolyte concentration, the acid–base equilibrium, and the renal function.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: This is a double blind randomized trial. Forty patients undergoing major abdominal surgery (bowel cancer) were allocated in two groups, the balanced solution (BS) group in which the fluids administered were balanced solutions (colloids and crystalloids); and the unbalanced solution (UBS) group in which the fluids administered were unbalanced solutions (colloids and crystalloids). Measurements were performed after anaesthesia induction (T0), at the end of surgery (T1), within 2 h after surgery (T2) and 24 h after the beginning of surgery (T3). The following data were collected: 1) active matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and its tissue inhibitor (TIMP-1), IL-6, IL-8, IL-10; 2) blood gases variables; 3) electrolytes, albumin, total serum protein and the strong ion difference; 4) neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) from urinary sample.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The BS group exhibited higher circulating level of IL-10 and TIMP-1 and lower level of active MMP-9. The UBS group experienced hypercloremia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, worse acid–base equilibrium and higher level of NGAL.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: The use of balanced solutions was responsible of less alteration of plasmatic electrolytes, acid–base equilibrium, kidney function and it might be associated with an early anti-inflammatory mechanisms triggering.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (Ref: NCT01320891).\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Balanced solutions\", \"Unbalanced solutions\", \"IL-10\", \"significantly increased\", \"The BS group exhibited higher circulating level of IL-10 and TIMP-1 and lower level of active MMP-9\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Assessment was performed at baseline and 1 week and included evaluations of pain (Brief Pain Inventory, BPI), distress (Distress Thermometer, DT), anxiety, and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS), QoL (QLQ-C30), and a Karnofsky score.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Overall (n = 108), pain intensity was significantly improved at 1 week, including worst pain (7.3 to 5.7, P < 0.01) and average pain (4.6 to 3.8, P < 0.01). Additionally, anxiety (HADS score ≥ 11, 75 % to 56 %, P < 0.01), depression (HADS score ≥ 11, 73 % to 51 %, P < 0.01), QoL (fatigue and insomnia), and the Karnofsky score (32 to 66, P < 0.01) were also significantly improved at 1 week. However, the level of distress did not improve. The telemonitoring plus standardized education group showed more significant improvement in portion of pain >4 on VAS scale (35 % vs. 19 %, P = 0.02).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Standardized pain education using nursing specialists is an efficient way to improve not only pain itself but also anxiety, depression, performance, and QoL. The addition of telemonitoring helps to improve pain management in the outpatient setting.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[[\"pain education plus telemonitoring\", \"pain education alone\", \"pain intensity\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Overall (n = 108), pain intensity was significantly improved at 1 week, including worst pain (7.3 to 5.7, P < 0.01) and average pain (4.6 to 3.8, P < 0.01).\"], [\"pain education plus telemonitoring\", \"pain education alone\", \"anxiety\", \"significantly decreased\", \"anxiety (HADS score ≥ 11, 75 % to 56 %, P < 0.01)\"], [\"pain education plus telemonitoring\", \"pain education alone\", \"depression\", \"significantly decreased\", \"depression (HADS score ≥ 11, 73 % to 51 %, P < 0.01)\"], [\"pain education plus telemonitoring\", \"pain education alone\", \"QoL\", \"significantly improved\", \"QoL (fatigue and insomnia)\"], [\"pain education plus telemonitoring\", \"pain education alone\", \"Karnofsky score\", \"significantly increased\", \"the Karnofsky score (32 to 66, P < 0.01)\"], [\"pain education plus telemonitoring\", \"pain education alone\", \"portion of pain >4 on VAS scale\", \"significantly increased\", \"the telemonitoring plus standardized education group showed more significant improvement in portion of pain >4 on VAS scale (35 % vs. 19 %, P = 0.02)\"]]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[[\"pain education plus telemonitoring\", \"pain education alone\", \"pain intensity\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Overall (n = 108), pain intensity was significantly improved at 1 week, including worst pain (7.3 to 5.7, P < 0.01) and average pain (4.6 to 3.8, P < 0.01).\"], [\"pain education plus telemonitoring\", \"pain education alone\", \"anxiety\", \"significantly decreased\", \"anxiety (HADS score ≥ 11, 75 % to 56 %, P < 0.01)\"], [\"pain education plus telemonitoring\", \"pain education alone\", \"depression\", \"significantly decreased\", \"depression (HADS score ≥ 11, 73 % to 51 %, P < 0.01)\"], [\"pain education plus telemonitoring\", \"pain education alone\", \"QoL\", \"significantly improved\", \"QoL (fatigue and insomnia)\"], [\"pain education plus telemonitoring\", \"pain education alone\", \"Karnofsky score\", \"significantly increased\", \"the Karnofsky score (32 to 66, P < 0.01)\"], [\"pain education plus telemonitoring\", \"pain education alone\", \"portion of pain >4 on VAS scale\", \"significantly increased\", \"the telemonitoring plus standardized education group showed more significant improvement in portion of pain >4 on VAS scale (35 % vs. 19 %, P = 0.02)\"]]"], "doc_hash": "839247b136532e000fab8431a27ec50c5f6eb32c76a912128660640a968fbd3c", "prompt_hash": "42c6ada2e885f6a072b8f08a09b15bf6ccba7442a9e456e0dc0e9eab948bec41", "target_hash": "a7ec56fb4368c2ab18d6efe3729cff42113fcfb6eae724fa4384c87a9bf69ab2", "bypass": null}

An ideal preload would entail minimal additional energy intake and might be optimized by concurrent inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). We evaluated the effects of a low-energy d-xylose preload, with or without sitagliptin, on gastric emptying, plasma intact GLP-1 concentrations, and postprandial glycemia in type 2 diabetes.\n\nABSTRACT.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twelve type 2 diabetic patients were studied on four occasions each. After 100 mg sitagliptin (S) or placebo (P) and an overnight fast, patients consumed a preload drink containing either 50 g d-xylose (X) or 80 mg sucralose (control [C]), followed after 40 min by a mashed potato meal labeled with 13C-octanoate. Blood was sampled at intervals. Gastric emptying was determined.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Both peak blood glucose and the amplitude of glycemic excursion were lower after PX and SC than PC (P < 0.01 for each) and were lowest after SX (P < 0.05 for each), while overall blood glucose was lower after SX than PC (P < 0.05). The postprandial insulin-to-glucose ratio was attenuated (P < 0.05) and gastric emptying was slower (P < 0.01) after d-xylose, without any effect of sitagliptin. Plasma GLP-1 concentrations were higher after d-xylose than control only before the meal (P < 0.05) but were sustained postprandially when combined with sitagliptin (P < 0.05).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: In type 2 diabetes, acute administration of a d-xylose preload reduces postprandial glycemia and enhances the effect of a DPP-4 inhibitor.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"sitagliptin and d-xylose\", \"placebo and sucralose\", \"peak blood glucose\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Both peak blood glucose and the amplitude of glycemic excursion were lower after PX and SC than PC (P \\u003c 0.01 for each) and were lowest after SX (P \\u003c 0.05 for each), while overall blood glucose was lower after SX than PC (P \\u003c 0.05).\"], [\"sitagliptin and d-xylose\", \"placebo and sucralose\", \"amplitude of glycemic excursion\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Both peak blood glucose and the amplitude of glycemic excursion were lower after PX and SC than PC (P \\u003c 0.01 for each) and were lowest after SX (P \\u003c 0.05 for each), while overall blood glucose was lower after SX than PC (P \\u003c 0.05).\"], [\"d-xylose\", \"sucralose\", \"plasma GLP-1 before consuming the meal\", \"significantly increased\", \"Plasma GLP-1 concentrations were higher after d-xylose than control only before the meal (P \\u003c 0.05) but were sustained postprandially when combined with sitagliptin (P \\u003c 0.05).\"], [\"sitagliptin and d-xylose\", \"placebo and sucralose\", \"overall blood glucose\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Both peak blood glucose and the amplitude of glycemic excursion were lower after PX and SC than PC (P \\u003c 0.01 for each) and were lowest after SX (P \\u003c 0.05 for each), while overall blood glucose was lower after SX than PC (P \\u003c 0.05).\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:23"}, "target": "[[\"sitagliptin and d-xylose\", \"placebo and sucralose\", \"peak blood glucose\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Both peak blood glucose and the amplitude of glycemic excursion were lower after PX and SC than PC (P \\u003c 0.01 for each) and were lowest after SX (P \\u003c 0.05 for each), while overall blood glucose was lower after SX than PC (P \\u003c 0.05).\"], [\"sitagliptin and d-xylose\", \"placebo and sucralose\", \"amplitude of glycemic excursion\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Both peak blood glucose and the amplitude of glycemic excursion were lower after PX and SC than PC (P \\u003c 0.01 for each) and were lowest after SX (P \\u003c 0.05 for each), while overall blood glucose was lower after SX than PC (P \\u003c 0.05).\"], [\"d-xylose\", \"sucralose\", \"plasma GLP-1 before consuming the meal\", \"significantly increased\", \"Plasma GLP-1 concentrations were higher after d-xylose than control only before the meal (P \\u003c 0.05) but were sustained postprandially when combined with sitagliptin (P \\u003c 0.05).\"], [\"sitagliptin and d-xylose\", \"placebo and sucralose\", \"overall blood glucose\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Both peak blood glucose and the amplitude of glycemic excursion were lower after PX and SC than PC (P \\u003c 0.01 for each) and were lowest after SX (P \\u003c 0.05 for each), while overall blood glucose was lower after SX than PC (P \\u003c 0.05).\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

Recommendations for prehypertension include engaging in regular physical activity. We aimed to assess feasibility and acceptability and collect preliminary outcome data on ChiRunning for people with elevated blood pressure. ChiRunning is a commercially available running program based on the mindful movements of Tai Chi, which is aimed at decreasing injury by both increasing body awareness and modifying running form.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: We enrolled adults with elevated systolic (130–150 mmHg) or diastolic (80–100 mmHg) blood pressure in a 12-week pilot trial. Participants were randomized 2:1:1 to 8 weeks of: 1) intervention—a trainer-led ChiRunning group (n = 10); 2) active control—a trainer-led running group (n = 6); or 3) educational control—a self-directed running group (n = 6) and followed for 4 more weeks. The active control and educational control groups were combined for analysis.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: This study was feasible, meeting recruitment, retention and adherence goals, and acceptable to participants. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly over the study for either the ChiRunning or control groups. Changes in BMI over time were significantly different from zero in the ChiRunning group (p = 0.04) but not in the control group (slope for ChiRunning −0.05 [−0.1 to −0.002] vs. control −0.01 [−0.06 to 0.04], between slope difference, p = 0.22). Self-reported running-related injury (i.e. discomfort leading to a decrease in running) was similar between groups (ChiRunning, 4 [1.2 to 8.4] vs. control, 3 [0.7 to 7.1] injuries per 100 h of running, p = 0.72) although self-reported running-related discomfort (i.e. discomfort that does not lead to changes in running) trended higher in the ChiRunning group (ChiRunning, 10 [5.4 to 16.8] vs. control, 4 [1.5 to 9] reports of discomfort per 100 h of running, p = 0.06).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: ChiRunning appears to be a feasible and acceptable exercise program for people with elevated blood pressure. We did not find that ChiRunning had a significant impact on blood pressure or self reported injury, but did see a positive change in BMI over time. ChiRunning warrants further investigation in a larger trial.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01587183\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Chi running program\", \"Control\", \"Systolic blood pressure \", \"no significant difference\", \"Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly over the study for either the ChiRunning or control groups.\"], [\"Chi running program\", \"Standard running program\", \"Diastolic blood pressure \", \"no significant difference\", \"Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly over the study for either the ChiRunning or control groups.\"], [\"Chi running program\", \"Standard running program\", \"Body mass index\", \"no significant difference\", \"Changes in BMI over time were significantly different from zero in the ChiRunning group (p = 0.04) but not in the control group (slope for ChiRunning \\u22120.05 [\\u22120.1 to \\u22120.002] vs. control \\u22120.01 [\\u22120.06 to 0.04], between slope difference, p = 0.22).\"], [\"Chi running program\", \"Standard running program\", \"Injury incidence \", \"no significant difference\", \"Self-reported running-related injury (i.e. discomfort leading to a decrease in running) was similar between groups (ChiRunning, 4 [1.2 to 8.4] vs. control, 3 [0.7 to 7.1] injuries per 100 h of running, p = 0.72)\"], [\"Chi running program\", \"Standard running program\", \"Systolic blood pressure \", \"no significant difference\", \"Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly over the study for either the ChiRunning or control groups.\"], [\"Chi running program\", \"Control\", \"Diastolic blood pressure \", \"no significant difference\", \"Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly over the study for either the ChiRunning or control groups.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Deliberate restriction of food intake (dieting) produces short-term weight loss but is largely unsuccessful for long-term weight management. Two promising approaches for the prevention of weight gain are intuitive eating (ie, eating in accordance with hunger and satiety signals) and the development of greater psychological flexibility (ie, the aim of acceptance and commitment therapy [ACT]).\n\nABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES: This pilot study investigated the usage, acceptability, and feasibility of \"Mind, Body, Food,\" a Web-based weight gain prevention intervention prototype that teaches intuitive eating and psychological flexibility skills.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Participants were 40 overweight women (mean age 44.8 [standard deviation, SD, 3.06] years, mean body mass index [BMI] 32.9 [SD 6.01] kg/m2, mean Intuitive Eating Scale [IES-1] total score 53.4 [SD 7.46], classified as below average) who were recruited from the general population in Dunedin, New Zealand. Module completion and study site metrics were assessed using Google Analytics. Use of an online self-monitoring tool was determined by entries saved to a secure online database. Intervention acceptability was assessed postintervention. BMI, intuitive eating, binge eating, psychological flexibility, and general mental and physical health were assessed pre- and postintervention and 3-months postintervention.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Of the 40 women enrolled in the study, 12 (30%) completed all 12 modules (median 7.5 [interquartile range, IQR, 2-12] modules) and 4 (10%) used the self-monitoring tool for all 14 weeks of the intervention period (median 3 [IQR 1-9] weeks). Among 26 women who completed postintervention assessments, most women rated \"Mind, Body, Food\" as useful (20/26, 77%), easy to use (17/25, 68%) and liked the intervention (22/25, 88%). From pre- to postintervention, there were statistically significant within-group increases in intuitive eating (IES-2 total score P<.001; all IES-2 subscale scores: P ≤.01), psychological flexibility (P=.01), and general mental health (P<.001) as well as significant decreases in binge eating (P=.01). At the 3-month follow-up, IES-2 improvements were maintained, and there were further improvements in binge eating (P<.001) and general mental health (P=.03), and a marginal yet nonsignificant tendency for further improvement in psychological flexibility (P=.06). There were no significant within-group changes in BMI from pre- to postintervention and postintervention to 3-month follow-up (P=.46 and P=.93, respectively).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: The \"Mind, Body, Food\" prototype Web-based intervention is appealing to middle-aged women and may be a useful tool to help women learn intuitive eating and ACT skills, reduce binge eating, and maintain weight over 3 months. Further work to improve the user experience and engagement is required before testing the online intervention in a randomized controlled trial.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Intuitive Eating and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy\", \"Control\", \"Intuitive eating total score \", \"significantly increased\", \"From pre- to postintervention, there were statistically significant within-group increases in intuitive eating (IES-2 total score P\\u003c.001; all IES-2 subscale scores: P \\u2264.01), psychological flexibility (P=.01), and general mental health (P\\u003c.001) as well as significant decreases in binge eating (P=.01)\"], [\"Intuitive Eating and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy\", \"Control\", \"Psychological flexibility\", \"significantly increased\", \"From pre- to postintervention, there were statistically significant within-group increases in intuitive eating (IES-2 total score P\\u003c.001; all IES-2 subscale scores: P \\u2264.01), psychological flexibility (P=.01), and general mental health (P\\u003c.001) as well as significant decreases in binge eating (P=.01)\"], [\"Intuitive Eating and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy\", \"Control\", \"General mental health \", \"significantly increased\", \"From pre- to postintervention, there were statistically significant within-group increases in intuitive eating (IES-2 total score P\\u003c.001; all IES-2 subscale scores: P \\u2264.01), psychological flexibility (P=.01), and general mental health (P\\u003c.001) as well as significant decreases in binge eating (P=.01)\"], [\"Intuitive Eating and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy\", \"Control\", \"Binge eating\", \"significantly decreased\", \"From pre- to postintervention, there were statistically significant within-group increases in intuitive eating (IES-2 total score P\\u003c.001; all IES-2 subscale scores: P \\u2264.01), psychological flexibility (P=.01), and general mental health (P\\u003c.001) as well as significant decreases in binge eating (P=.01)\"], [\"Intuitive Eating and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy\", \"Control\", \"BMI\", \"no significant difference\", \"There were no significant within-group changes in BMI from pre- to postintervention and postintervention to 3-month follow-up (P=.46 and P=.93, respectively).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

We investigated the effect of statin treatment (targeted to achieve guideline goals) on CVD outcomes in different age groups to determine whether statins are more beneficial in the elderly.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The primary endpoint of this post hoc analysis of the GREek Atorvastatin and Coronary-heart-disease Evaluation (GREACE) study (n = 1,600 patients with established coronary heart disease (CHD), mean follow-up 3 years) was the absolute and relative CVD event (a composite of death, myocardial infarction, revascularization, unstable angina, heart failure and stroke) risk reduction in age quartiles (each n = 200). Patients on \"structured care\" with atorvastatin (n = 800) followed up by the university clinic and treated to lipid goal were compared with the corresponding quartiles on \"usual care\" (n = 800) followed up by specialists or general practitioners of the patient's choice outside the hospital.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: In the elderly (mean age 69 ±4 and 70 ±3 years in the \"structured\" and \"usual care\", respectively) the absolute CVD event reduction between \"structured\" and \"usual care\" was 16.5% (p < 0.0001), while in the younger patients (mean age 51 ±3 years and 52 ±3 years in the \"structured\" and \"usual care\", respectively) this was 8.5% (p = 0.016); relative risk reduction (RRR) 60% (p < 0.0001) vs. 42% respectively (p = 0.001). The elderly had higher rates of chronic kidney disease and higher uric acid levels, plus an increased prevalence of diabetes, metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. These factors might contribute to the increased CVD risk in older patients.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: All age groups benefited from statin treatment, but the elderly on \"structured care\" had a greater absolute and relative CVD risk reduction than the younger patients when compared with the corresponding patients assigned to \"usual care\".

This receptor profile makes it possible for it to act as a dopamine system stabilizer. Based on various short term and long term studies, aripiprazole has been found to be effective in schizophrenia and has no significant adverse effect on QTc prolongation, prolactin, serum lipids, and has a low potential for weight gain. Present study aims to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of aripiprazole (10-15mg/day) in the treatment of Indian patients of schizophrenia and to see its effect on QTc interval, prolactin levels, serum lipids, plasma sugar and weight gain in these patients. Outpatients with an ongoing/newly diagnosed ICD-10 Schizophrenia (n=136) were randomly assigned to 10 or 15 mg dose of Aripiprazole for a period of six weeks. Clinical response was evaluated by the Positive And Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS), Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale and safety was evaluated by observing spontaneously reported adverse events and changes in various laboratory parameters. Switching schizophrenic patients to aripiprazole (10/15 mg) from both conventional and atypical anti-psychotics was safe and well tolerated. Six weeks after switching to aripiprazole, patients showed improvements in PANSS scores (P< 0.001), EPS, prolactin levels and weight over the baseline levels. No difference was seen in the 10 or 15mg dose groups. One hospitalization was reported (due to hepatitis E). Common side effects reported were insomnia, somnolence, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Aripiprazole is a safe and effective anti psychotic in Indian patients - both in newly diagnosed, as well as, in patients not responding to or intolerant to other available typical and atypical antipsychotics.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"aripiprazole (10-15mg/day)\", \"baseline\", \"Positive And Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS)\", \"significantly increased\", \"Six weeks after switching to aripiprazole, patients showed improvements in PANSS scores (P\\u003c 0.001),\"], [\"aripiprazole (10-15mg/day)\", \"baseline\", \"Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), prolactin levels and weight\", \"no significant difference\", \"EPS, prolactin levels and weight over the baseline levels\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

This study aimed to compare HRQOL in patients with advanced gastric cancer (GC) receiving either a standard or an experimental treatment.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Seventy-one patients have been treated in Cancer Institute (Tehran, Iran) with docetaxel, cisplatin, 5 FU (TCF) or epirubicin, cisplatin, 5-FU (ECF) and were followed from Jan 2002 to Jan 2005. End points were response rate, HRQOL and survival. HRQOL was assessed using the EORCT QLQ-C30 at baseline and after the third cycle of chemotherapy.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The baseline HRQOL scores were comparable between two groups. After treatment improvement was seen in a number of items and domains except for cognitive functioning, and diarrhoea. Pain decreased and physical functioning improved in both groups.

Our objective was to assess the validity of gestational age estimated from prospectively collected date of last menstrual period (LMP) using crown-rump length (CRL) measured in early pregnancy by ultrasound.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: As part of a large, cluster-randomized, controlled trial in rural Bangladesh, we collected dates of LMP by recall and as marked on a calendar every 5 weeks in women likely to become pregnant. Among those with a urine-test confirmed pregnancy, a subset with gestational age of <15 weeks (n = 353) were enrolled for ultrasound follow-up to measure CRL. We compared interview-assessed LMP with CRL gestational age estimates and classification of preterm, term, and post-term births.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: LMP-based gestational age was higher than CRL by a mean (SD) of 2.8 (10.7) days; differences varied by maternal education and preterm birth (P < 0.05). Lin's concordance correlation coefficient was good at ultrasound [0.63 (95 % CI 0.56, 0.69)] and at birth [0.77 (95 % CI 0.73, 0.81)]. Validity of classifying preterm birth was high but post-term was lower, with specificity of 96 and 89 % and sensitivity of 86 and 67 %, respectively. Results were similar by parity.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Prospectively collected LMP provided a valid estimate of gestational age and preterm birth in a rural, low-income setting and may be a suitable alternative to ultrasound in programmatic settings and large field trials.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00860470\n\n\nABSTRACT.ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s41043-016-0072-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Last menstrual period method\", \"Crown-rump length method\", \"Gestational age at birth \", \"significantly increased\", \"LMP-based gestational age was higher than CRL by a mean (SD) of 2.8 (10.7) days\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

This study aimed to compare HRQOL in patients with advanced gastric cancer (GC) receiving either a standard or an experimental treatment.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Seventy-one patients have been treated in Cancer Institute (Tehran, Iran) with docetaxel, cisplatin, 5 FU (TCF) or epirubicin, cisplatin, 5-FU (ECF) and were followed from Jan 2002 to Jan 2005. End points were response rate, HRQOL and survival. HRQOL was assessed using the EORCT QLQ-C30 at baseline and after the third cycle of chemotherapy.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The baseline HRQOL scores were comparable between two groups. After treatment improvement was seen in a number of items and domains except for cognitive functioning, and diarrhoea. Pain decreased and physical functioning improved in both groups. However, only the TCF group showed statistically and clinically meaningful improvement in global QOL (P = 0.001). Surgical and pathologic response was better with TCF but there was no difference in survival rate between two groups.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Docetaxel based treatment (TCF) showed better palliation and improvement of global QOL as compared with epirubicin based treatment (ECF).

We evaluated the efficacy of dexamethasone added to ramosetron, which is a newly developed five-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3 antagonist with a higher receptor affinity and longer action duration compared to its congeners, on preventing PONV in highly susceptible patients receiving opioid-based IV PCA after spinal surgery.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: One hundred nonsmoking female patients undergoing spinal surgery were randomly allocated to either a ramosetron group (group R) or a ramosetron plus dexamethasone group (group RD)., Normal saline (1 ml) or 5 mg of dexamethasone was injected before anesthetic induction, while at the end of the surgery, ramosetron (0.3 mg) was administered to all patients and fentanyl-based IV PCA was continued for 48 hrs. The incidence and severity of PONV, pain score and the amount of rescue antiemetics were assessed for 48 hours after surgery.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The number of patients with moderate to severe nausea (20 vs. 10, P = 0.029), and overall incidence of vomiting (13 vs. 5, P = 0.037) were significantly lower in the group RD than in the group R, respectively.

Comprehensive eye examination and binocular vision assessment was carried out for 94 children (mean (SD) age: 15 (2.2) years) diagnosed with specific learning disorder. BV assessment was done for children with best corrected visual acuity of ≥6/9 – N6, cooperative for examination and free from any ocular pathology. For children with a diagnosis of NSBVA (n = 46), 24 children were randomized to VT and no intervention was provided to the other 22 children who served as experimental controls. At the end of 10 sessions of vision therapy, BV assessment was performed for both the intervention and non-intervention groups.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Binocular vision anomalies were found in 59 children (62.8%) among which 22% (n = 13) had strabismic binocular vision anomalies (SBVA) and 78% (n = 46) had a NSBVA. Accommodative infacility (AIF) was the commonest of the NSBVA and found in 67%, followed by convergence insufficiency (CI) in 25%. Post-vision therapy, the intervention group showed significant improvement in all the BV parameters (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p < 0.05) except negative fusional vergence.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Children with specific learning disorders have a high frequency of binocular vision disorders and vision therapy plays a significant role in improving the BV parameters.

To investigate H. pylori infection rate and evaluate a combined set of tests for H. pylori diagnosis in Vietnamese patients with acute peptic ulcer bleeding (PUD). Methods. Consecutive patients with acute PUB were enrolled prospectively. Rapid urease test (RUT) with 3 biopsies was carried out randomly. Patients without RUT or with negative RUT received urea breath test (UBT) and serological and urinary H. pylori antibody tests. H. pylori was considered positive if RUT or any noninvasive test was positive. Patients were divided into group A (RUT plus noninvasive tests) and group B (only noninvasive tests). Results. The overall H. pylori infection rate was 94.2% (161/171). Groups A and B had no differences in demographic characteristics, bleeding severity, endoscopic findings, and proton pump inhibitor use. H. pylori-positive rate in group A was significantly higher than that in group B (98.2% versus 86.7%, p = 0.004).

Comprehensive eye examination and binocular vision assessment was carried out for 94 children (mean (SD) age: 15 (2.2) years) diagnosed with specific learning disorder. BV assessment was done for children with best corrected visual acuity of ≥6/9 – N6, cooperative for examination and free from any ocular pathology. For children with a diagnosis of NSBVA (n = 46), 24 children were randomized to VT and no intervention was provided to the other 22 children who served as experimental controls. At the end of 10 sessions of vision therapy, BV assessment was performed for both the intervention and non-intervention groups.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Binocular vision anomalies were found in 59 children (62.8%) among which 22% (n = 13) had strabismic binocular vision anomalies (SBVA) and 78% (n = 46) had a NSBVA. Accommodative infacility (AIF) was the commonest of the NSBVA and found in 67%, followed by convergence insufficiency (CI) in 25%. Post-vision therapy, the intervention group showed significant improvement in all the BV parameters (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p < 0.05) except negative fusional vergence.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Children with specific learning disorders have a high frequency of binocular vision disorders and vision therapy plays a significant role in improving the BV parameters.

Since these reductions may lead to dangerous complications, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of vasopressors and isotonic fluids on hemodynamic status of cardiac surgery patients during their transfer to ICU.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: This randomized single-blind clinical trial was conducted in Chamran Hospital (Isfahan, Iran). A total number of 75 consecutive patients undergoing planned first-time coronary artery bypass grafting entered our study. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), CVP, and pulse rate (PR) were recorded at 5 to 10 minutes before leaving operating room and immediately after hospitalization in the ICU. Subjects in the first group received 7 cc/kg intravenous normal saline (as an isotonic fluid) within 5-10 minutes. The second group received 10 mg ephedrine before being transferred to the ICU.\n\nABSTRACT. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 61.0 ± 3.6 years. No significant change in PR was detected in normal saline group (P > 0.05). No significant differences were found in two groups in SBP before and after hospitalization in the ICU (P > 0.05). DBP and CVP had statistically significant reductions in both groups after hospitalization in the ICU (P < 0.001). The mean CVP was also reduced significantly (10.7 ± 2.9 vs. 8.2 ± 3.4; P < 0.001).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Significant reductions in mean values of DBP and CVP occur during cardiac surgery and after arrival to the ICU. These reductions cannot be prevented by administration of vasopressors, such as ephedrine, or infusion of isotonic fluids, such as normal saline. Further studies are required to assess whether more fluids, other types of fluids, or other drugs can stop this phenomenon.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Ephedrine\", \"Control (nothing)\", \"Systolic blood preasure\", \"no significant difference\", \"No significant differences were found in two groups in SBP before and after hospitalization in the ICU (P \\u003e 0.05)\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

This exploratory study investigated whether two mind–body interventions, i.e., Mind–Body Bridging (MBB) and Mindfulness Meditation (MM), could improve posttreatment cancer survivors' self-reported sleep disturbance and comorbid symptoms, as compared to sleep hygiene education (SHE) as an active control.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: This randomized controlled trial examined 57 cancer survivors with clinically significant self-reported sleep disturbance, randomly assigned to receive MBB, MM, or SHE. All interventions were conducted in three sessions, once per week. Patient-reported outcomes were assessed via the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale and other indicators of psychosocial functioning relevant to quality of life, stress, depression, mindfulness, self-compassion, and well-being.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Mixed effects model analysis revealed that mean sleep disturbance symptoms in the MBB (p = .0029) and MM (p = .0499) groups were lower than in the SHE group, indicating that both mind–body interventions improved sleep. In addition, compared with the SHE group, the MBB group showed reductions in self-reported depression symptoms (p = .040) and improvements in overall levels of mindfulness (p = .018), self-compassion (p = .028), and well-being (p = .019) at postintervention.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence that brief sleep-focused MBB and MM are promising interventions for sleep disturbance in cancer survivors. Integrating MBB or MM into posttreatment supportive plans should enhance care of cancer survivors with sleep disturbance. Because MBB produced additional secondary benefits, MBB may serve as a promising multipurpose intervention for posttreatment cancer survivors suffering from sleep disturbance and other comorbid symptoms.\n\nABSTRACT.IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Two brief sleep-focused mind–body interventions investigated in the study were effective in reducing sleep disturbance and one of them further improved other psychosocial aspects of the cancer survivors' life.

This exploratory study investigated whether two mind–body interventions, i.e., Mind–Body Bridging (MBB) and Mindfulness Meditation (MM), could improve posttreatment cancer survivors' self-reported sleep disturbance and comorbid symptoms, as compared to sleep hygiene education (SHE) as an active control.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: This randomized controlled trial examined 57 cancer survivors with clinically significant self-reported sleep disturbance, randomly assigned to receive MBB, MM, or SHE. All interventions were conducted in three sessions, once per week. Patient-reported outcomes were assessed via the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale and other indicators of psychosocial functioning relevant to quality of life, stress, depression, mindfulness, self-compassion, and well-being.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Mixed effects model analysis revealed that mean sleep disturbance symptoms in the MBB (p = .0029) and MM (p = .0499) groups were lower than in the SHE group, indicating that both mind–body interventions improved sleep. In addition, compared with the SHE group, the MBB group showed reductions in self-reported depression symptoms (p = .040) and improvements in overall levels of mindfulness (p = .018), self-compassion (p = .028), and well-being (p = .019) at postintervention.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence that brief sleep-focused MBB and MM are promising interventions for sleep disturbance in cancer survivors. Integrating MBB or MM into posttreatment supportive plans should enhance care of cancer survivors with sleep disturbance. Because MBB produced additional secondary benefits, MBB may serve as a promising multipurpose intervention for posttreatment cancer survivors suffering from sleep disturbance and other comorbid symptoms.\n\nABSTRACT.IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Two brief sleep-focused mind–body interventions investigated in the study were effective in reducing sleep disturbance and one of them further improved other psychosocial aspects of the cancer survivors' life. Management of sleep problems in survivors is a high priority issue that demands more attention in cancer survivorship.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"Mind–Body Bridging (MBB)\", \"sleep hygiene education (SHE)\", \"sleep disturbance symptoms\", \"significantly decreased\", \"mean sleep disturbance symptoms in the MBB group were lower than in the SHE group (p = .0029)\"],\n    [\"Mindfulness Meditation (MM)\", \"sleep hygiene education (SHE)\", \"sleep disturbance symptoms\", \"significantly decreased\", \"mean sleep disturbance symptoms in the MM group were lower than in the SHE group (p = .0499)\"],\n    [\"Mind–Body Bridging (MBB)\", \"sleep hygiene education (SHE)\", \"depression symptoms\", \"significantly decreased\", \"the MBB group showed reductions in self-reported depression symptoms compared with the SHE group (p = .040)\"],\n    [\"Mind–Body Bridging (MBB)\", \"sleep hygiene education (SHE)\", \"overall levels of mindfulness\", \"significantly increased\", \"the MBB group showed improvements in overall levels of mindfulness compared with the SHE group (p = .018)\"],\n    [\"Mind–Body Bridging (MBB)\", \"sleep hygiene education (SHE)\", \"self-compassion\", \"significantly increased\", \"the MBB group showed improvements in self-compassion compared with the SHE group (p = .028)\"],\n    [\"Mind–Body Bridging (MBB)\", \"sleep hygiene education (SHE)\", \"well-being\", \"significantly increased\", \"the MBB group showed improvements in well-being compared with the SHE group (p = .019)\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"Mind–Body Bridging (MBB)\", \"sleep hygiene education (SHE)\", \"sleep disturbance symptoms\", \"significantly decreased\", \"mean sleep disturbance symptoms in the MBB group were lower than in the SHE group (p = .0029)\"],\n    [\"Mindfulness Meditation (MM)\", \"sleep hygiene education (SHE)\", \"sleep disturbance symptoms\", \"significantly decreased\", \"mean sleep disturbance symptoms in the MM group were lower than in the SHE group (p = .0499)\"],\n    [\"Mind–Body Bridging (MBB)\", \"sleep hygiene education (SHE)\", \"depression symptoms\", \"significantly decreased\", \"the MBB group showed reductions in self-reported depression symptoms compared with the SHE group (p = .040)\"],\n    [\"Mind–Body Bridging (MBB)\", \"sleep hygiene education (SHE)\", \"overall levels of mindfulness\", \"significantly increased\", \"the MBB group showed improvements in overall levels of mindfulness compared with the SHE group (p = .018)\"],\n    [\"Mind–Body Bridging (MBB)\", \"sleep hygiene education (SHE)\", \"self-compassion\", \"significantly increased\", \"the MBB group showed improvements in self-compassion compared with the SHE group (p = .028)\"],\n    [\"Mind–Body Bridging (MBB)\", \"sleep hygiene education (SHE)\", \"well-being\", \"significantly increased\", \"the MBB group showed improvements in well-being compared with the SHE group (p = .019)\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "f40b41b4b71296028c47e4b87ad01290aa2716fa5f7b8b55f3fd99074e3c86d4", "prompt_hash": "6e955ef26c431110e5ffa1f43b9598297c7091f70a8918a97344e5caa99df7b8", "target_hash": "e22988e694ab124d01377975b399c9cb2de8fa3bd5602a038454893b43a0bfee", "bypass": null}

In this retrospective pooled analysis of these studies we assessed whether the zofenopril effect is influenced by gender.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: the four double-blind, randomized, parallel-group SMILE studies, compared the efficacy and safety of 6–48 week treatment with zofenopril 60 mg/day with that of placebo, lisinopril 10 mg/day or ramipril 10 mg/day in 3630 AMI patients. This pooled analysis compared treatment efficacy (1-year combined occurrence of death or hospitalization for CV causes) in 2733 men and 897 women.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: women were older than men, had a higher prevalence of diabetes and of other major CV risk factors. The risk of a major CV event was significantly larger for women (23% vs. 17% men, p<0.001). Between-gender risk difference was more marked for people living in Southern (+54%) than in Northern Europe (+12%). In both genders zofenopril similarly reduced the 1-year risk of CV morbidity and mortality vs. placebo (−39% men, p = 0.0001; −40% women, p = 0.005). The risk reduction was more marked with zofenopril than with the other ACEIs, particularly in men (−27%, p = 0.012; women: −14%, p = 0.479).

Actual exposure to CT interventions is not living up to its high expectations, as only a (limited) proportion of the target group is actually using these programs.\n\nABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE: To investigate exposure to an Internet-delivered, CT lifestyle intervention, targeting physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, smoking behavior, and alcohol intake, we focused on three processes: first use, prolonged use, and sustained use. The first objectives were to identify user characteristics that predict initiation of an online CT lifestyle program (first use) and completion of this program (prolonged use). Furthermore, we studied the effect of using a proactive strategy, consisting of periodic email prompts, on program revisits (sustained use).\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: The research population for this study consisted of Dutch adults participating in the Adult Health Monitor, offered by the regional public health services. We used a randomized controlled trial design to assess predictors of first use, prolonged use, and sustained use. Demographics and behavioral characteristics, as well as the strategy used for revisiting, were included as predictors in the model.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: A total of 9169 participants indicated their interest in the new program and 5168 actually logged in to the program. Participants significantly more likely to initiate one of the CT modules were male, older, and employed, and had a lower income, higher body mass index, and relatively unhealthy lifestyle. Participants significantly more likely to complete one of the CT modules were older and had a higher income and a relatively healthier lifestyle. Finally, using a proactive strategy influenced sustained use, with people from the prompting condition being more likely to revisit the program (odds ratio 28.92, 95% confidence interval 10.65–78.52; P < .001).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Older, male, and employed participants, and those with a lower income, higher body mass index, and a relatively unhealthy lifestyle were more likely to initiate a CT module. Module completers predominantly had a higher income and age. The current program therefore succeeded in reaching those people who benefit most from online lifestyle interventions. However, these people tended to disengage from the program. This underlines the importance of additional research into program adjustments and strategies that can be used to stimulate prolonged program use. Furthermore, sending periodic email prompts significantly increased revisits to the program. Though promising, this effect was modest and needs to be further examined, in order to maximize the potential of periodic email prompting.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Nederlands Trial Register (NTR: 1786) and Medical Ethics Committee of Maastricht University and the University Hospital Maastricht (NL2723506809/MEC0903016); http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=1786 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/65hBXA6V7)\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Periodic Email Prompt\", \"Control\", \"Revisiting the program\", \"significantly increased\", \"Finally, using a proactive strategy influenced sustained use, with people from the prompting condition being more likely to revisit the program (odds ratio 28.92, 95% confidence interval 10.65\\u201378.52; P \\u003c .001).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Web-based interventions incorporating feedback and group features may represent opportune, convenient, and cost-effective methods for encouraging physical activity (PA) in order to improve the levels of PA and cardiovascular health of nurses. The purpose of this parallel-group randomized trial was to examine the impact of an intervention providing participants with feedback from an activity monitor coupled with a web-based individual, friend or team PA challenge, on the PA and cardiovascular health of nurses working in a cardiovascular setting. <p> Methods: Nurses were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the following intervention \"challenge\" groups: (1) individual, (2) friend or (3) team. Nurses wore a Tractivity® activity monitor throughout a baseline week and 6-week intervention. Height, body mass, body fat percentage, waist circumference, resting blood pressure (BP) and heart rate were assessed, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated, during baseline and within 1 week post-intervention. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and general linear model procedures for repeated measures. <p> Results: 76 nurses (97% female; age: 46 ± 11 years) participated. Weekly moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA (MVPA) changed over time (F = 4.022, df = 4.827, p = 0.002, η2 = 0.055), and was greater during intervention week 2 when compared to intervention week 6 (p = 0.011). Daily steps changed over time (F = 7.668, df = 3.910, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.100), and were greater during baseline and intervention weeks 1, 2, 3, and 5 when compared to intervention week 6 (p < 0.05). No differences in weekly MVPA or daily steps were observed between groups (p > 0.05). No changes in body mass, BMI or waist circumference were observed within or between groups (p > 0.05). Decreases in body fat percentage (−0.8 ± 4.8%, p = 0.015) and resting systolic BP (−2.6 ± 8.8 mmHg, p = 0.019) were observed within groups, but not between groups (p > 0.05). <p> Conclusions: A web-based intervention providing feedback and a PA challenge initially impacted the PA, body fat percentage and resting systolic BP of nurses working in a cardiovascular setting, though increases in PA were short-lived. The nature of the PA challenge did not differentially impact outcomes. Alternative innovative strategies to improve and sustain nurses' PA should be developed and their effectiveness evaluated.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"individual or friend \", \"team\", \" Weekly moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA (MVPA) levels\", \"no significant difference\", \"No differences in weekly MVPA or daily steps were observed between groups (p \\u003e 0.05).\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:238"}, "target": "[[\"individual or friend \", \"team\", \" Weekly moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA (MVPA) levels\", \"no significant difference\", \"No differences in weekly MVPA or daily steps were observed between groups (p \\u003e 0.05).\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

We designed this study to evaluate the efficiency of a traditional herbal preparation (Lax-Asab) in treating chronic constipation. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, participants with chronic constipation (n = 48) were randomly selected to receive either the Lax-Asab powder (n = 24) or placebo (n = 24) on alternative days for 4 weeks. The Lax-Asab powder contains equal amounts of Cassia angustifolia Vahl. (狹葉番瀉葉 xiá yè fān xiè yè), Mentha piperita L. (胡椒薄荷 hú jiāo bò hé), Zingiber officinale Rosc. (生薑 shēng jiāng), Glycyrrhiza glabra L. (甘草 gān cǎo). A total of 40 patients completed the study. We determined the severity of constipation based on defecation frequency (per week) and defecation difficulties. Of the total of 48 patients who participated, 40 completed the trial [24 men (60%), mean age, 21.0 ± 4.2 years; 16 women (40%), mean age, 20.1 ± 4.3 years]. The mean of weekly defecation frequency increased in both groups; from 1.8 ± 0.41 to 4.8 ± 1.12 times in patients who received Lax-Asab and from 1.7 ± 0.44 to 2.2 ± 0.61 times in patients who received placebo. A time–treatment interaction showed that this increase was significantly higher in the intervention group. Defecation difficulties improved significantly more in patients who received Lax-Asab than patients who received placebo. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups with regard to the side effects observed. This study confirms the efficacy and tolerability of an Iranian herbal preparation, Lax-Asab, in treating patients with chronic functional constipation.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Lax-Asab powder\", \"placebo\", \"efficacy of treating patients with chronic functional constipation\", \"significantly increased\", \"This study confirms the efficacy and tolerability of an Iranian herbal preparation, Lax-Asab, in treating patients with chronic functional constipation.\"], [\"Lax-Asab powder\", \"placebo\", \"mean of weekly defecation frequency increase\", \"significantly increased\", \"The mean of weekly defecation frequency increased in both groups; from 1.8 \\u00b1 0.41 to 4.8 \\u00b1 1.12 times in patients who received Lax-Asab and from 1.7 \\u00b1 0.44 to 2.2 \\u00b1 0.61 times in patients who received placebo.

Web-based interventions incorporating feedback and group features may represent opportune, convenient, and cost-effective methods for encouraging physical activity (PA) in order to improve the levels of PA and cardiovascular health of nurses. The purpose of this parallel-group randomized trial was to examine the impact of an intervention providing participants with feedback from an activity monitor coupled with a web-based individual, friend or team PA challenge, on the PA and cardiovascular health of nurses working in a cardiovascular setting. <p> Methods: Nurses were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the following intervention \"challenge\" groups: (1) individual, (2) friend or (3) team. Nurses wore a Tractivity® activity monitor throughout a baseline week and 6-week intervention. Height, body mass, body fat percentage, waist circumference, resting blood pressure (BP) and heart rate were assessed, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated, during baseline and within 1 week post-intervention. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and general linear model procedures for repeated measures. <p> Results: 76 nurses (97% female; age: 46 ± 11 years) participated. Weekly moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA (MVPA) changed over time (F = 4.022, df = 4.827, p = 0.002, η2 = 0.055), and was greater during intervention week 2 when compared to intervention week 6 (p = 0.011). Daily steps changed over time (F = 7.668, df = 3.910, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.100), and were greater during baseline and intervention weeks 1, 2, 3, and 5 when compared to intervention week 6 (p < 0.05). No differences in weekly MVPA or daily steps were observed between groups (p > 0.05). No changes in body mass, BMI or waist circumference were observed within or between groups (p > 0.05). Decreases in body fat percentage (−0.8 ± 4.8%, p = 0.015) and resting systolic BP (−2.6 ± 8.8 mmHg, p = 0.019) were observed within groups, but not between groups (p > 0.05). <p> Conclusions: A web-based intervention providing feedback and a PA challenge initially impacted the PA, body fat percentage and resting systolic BP of nurses working in a cardiovascular setting, though increases in PA were short-lived. The nature of the PA challenge did not differentially impact outcomes. Alternative innovative strategies to improve and sustain nurses' PA should be developed and their effectiveness evaluated.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[[\"intervention providing participants with feedback from an activity monitor coupled with a web-based individual, friend or team PA challenge\", \"null\", \"weekly moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA (MVPA)\", \"significantly increased\", \"Weekly moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA (MVPA) changed over time (F = 4.022, df = 4.827, p = 0.002, η2 = 0.055), and was greater during intervention week 2 when compared to intervention week 6 (p = 0.011).\"], [\"intervention providing participants with feedback from an activity monitor coupled with a web-based individual, friend or team PA challenge\", \"null\", \"daily steps\", \"significantly increased\", \"Daily steps changed over time (F = 7.668, df = 3.910, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.100), and were greater during baseline and intervention weeks 1, 2, 3, and 5 when compared to intervention week 6 (p < 0.05).\"], [\"intervention providing participants with feedback from an activity monitor coupled with a web-based individual, friend or team PA challenge\", \"null\", \"body fat percentage\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Decreases in body fat percentage (−0.8 ± 4.8%, p = 0.015) were observed within groups, but not between groups (p > 0.05).\"], [\"intervention providing participants with feedback from an activity monitor coupled with a web-based individual, friend or team PA challenge\", \"null\", \"resting systolic BP\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Decreases in resting systolic BP (−2.6 ± 8.8 mmHg, p = 0.019) were observed within groups, but not between groups (p > 0.05).\"]]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[[\"intervention providing participants with feedback from an activity monitor coupled with a web-based individual, friend or team PA challenge\", \"null\", \"weekly moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA (MVPA)\", \"significantly increased\", \"Weekly moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA (MVPA) changed over time (F = 4.022, df = 4.827, p = 0.002, η2 = 0.055), and was greater during intervention week 2 when compared to intervention week 6 (p = 0.011).\"], [\"intervention providing participants with feedback from an activity monitor coupled with a web-based individual, friend or team PA challenge\", \"null\", \"daily steps\", \"significantly increased\", \"Daily steps changed over time (F = 7.668, df = 3.910, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.100), and were greater during baseline and intervention weeks 1, 2, 3, and 5 when compared to intervention week 6 (p < 0.05).\"], [\"intervention providing participants with feedback from an activity monitor coupled with a web-based individual, friend or team PA challenge\", \"null\", \"body fat percentage\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Decreases in body fat percentage (−0.8 ± 4.8%, p = 0.015) were observed within groups, but not between groups (p > 0.05).\"], [\"intervention providing participants with feedback from an activity monitor coupled with a web-based individual, friend or team PA challenge\", \"null\", \"resting systolic BP\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Decreases in resting systolic BP (−2.6 ± 8.8 mmHg, p = 0.019) were observed within groups, but not between groups (p > 0.05).\"]]"], "doc_hash": "c1bea96b3437944c6154cd680ac591e3106d570537e94479d08016152b1be454", "prompt_hash": "9794aa9880c3ab3e1fb3604e151a3493b38e31438472924fb248f4eb356c5b2f", "target_hash": "22fbc85323246eb030a98adbca98b70682d72b2da7105cd909940f54afdd9766", "bypass": null}

The purpose of this prospective trial is to examine the short-term effects of customized arch support insoles on symptomatic flexible flatfoot in children by using the International Classification of Functioning, randomized controlled Disability, and Health (ICF) framework.\n\nABSTRACT.ABSTRACT.METHODS:: This study was conducted in a rehabilitation outpatient clinic of a teaching hospital. Fifty-two children with symptomatic flexible flatfoot were included. The children in the treatment group wore customized arch support insoles for 12 weeks, whereas those in the control group did not wear the insoles. Both clinical and radiographic measurements, including the navicular drop, foot posture index, Beighton hypermobility score, talonavicular coverage angle, calcaneal inclination angle, and calcaneal-first metatarsal angle, were used for diagnosing flexible flatfoot. Physical activity (10-m normal and fast walking, stair ascent, stair descent, and chair rising), physical function, and psychometric properties (Pediatric Outcome Data Collection Instrument and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory) were evaluated at the baseline and 12 weeks after the intervention.\n\nABSTRACT.ABSTRACT.RESULTS:: Compared with the control group, the treatment group exhibited significant improvement in pain/comfort (P = .048), physical health (P = .035), stair ascent time (P = .015), upper extremity and physical function (P = .016), and transfer and basic mobility (P = .042) during the intervention period.\n\nABSTRACT.ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: Children with flexible flatfoot who wore customized arch support insoles for 12 weeks exhibited significantly improved pain/comfort, physical health, stair ascent time, upper extremity and physical function, and transfer and basic mobility. These variables belong to the domains of body functions and structures and activity and participation in the ICF framework. However, because the groups were not comparable, additional studies with larger sample sizes should be conducted.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"arch support insoles for 12 weeks\", \"did not wear the insoles\", \"stair ascent time\", \"significantly increased\", \"the treatment group exhibited significant improvement in pain/comfort (P\\u200a=\\u200a.048), physical health (P\\u200a=\\u200a.035), stair ascent time (P\\u200a=\\u200a.015\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

In patients who have no concordance between radiological and clinical symptoms, the surgical levels determined by conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neurogenic examination (NE) may lead to a more extensive surgery and significant complications. We aimed to confirm that whether the use of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and paraspinal mapping (PM) techniques can further prevent the occurrence of false positives with conventional MRI, distinguish which are clinically relevant from levels of cauda equina and/or nerve root lesions based on MRI, and determine and reduce the decompression levels of lumbar spinal stenosis than MRI + NE, while ensuring or improving surgical outcomes.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: We compared the data between patients who underwent MRI + (PM or DTI) and patients who underwent conventional MRI + NE to determine levels of decompression for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis. Outcome measures were assessed at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months postoperatively.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: One hundred fourteen patients (59 in the control group, 54 in the experimental group) underwent decompression. The levels of decompression determined by MRI + (PM or DTI) in the experimental group were significantly less than that determined by MRI + NE in the control group (p = 0.000). The surgical time, blood loss, and surgical transfusion were significantly less in the experimental group (p = 0.001, p = 0.011, p = 0.001, respectively). There were no differences in improvement of the visual analog scale back and leg pain (VAS-BP, VAS-LP) scores and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after operation between the experimental and control groups.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: MRI + (PM or DTI) showed clear benefits in determining decompression levels of lumbar spinal stenosis than MRI + NE.

Outpatient IOL is an attractive option to reduce these impacts. To date there is little data comparing outpatient and inpatient IOL methods, and potential safety concerns (hyperstimulation) if prostaglandins, the standard inpatient IOL medications, are used in the outpatient setting. The purpose of this study was to assess feasibility, clinical effectiveness and patient acceptability of outpatient Foley catheter (OPC) vs. inpatient vaginal PGE2 (IP) for induction of labour (IOL) at term.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Women with an unfavourable cervix requiring IOL at term (N = 101) were randomised to outpatient care using Foley catheter (OPC, n = 50) or inpatient care using vaginal PGE2 (IP, n = 51). OPC group had Foley catheter inserted and were discharged overnight following a reassuring cardiotocograph. IP group received 2 mg/1 mg vaginal PGE2 if nulliparous or 1 mg/1 mg if multiparous. Main outcome measures were inpatient stay (prior to birth, in Birthing Unit, total), mode of birth, induction to delivery interval, adverse reactions and patient satisfaction.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: OPC group had shorter hospital stay prior to birth (21.3 vs. 32.4 hrs, p < .001), IP were more likely to achieve vaginal birth within 12 hours of presenting to Birthing Unit (53% vs. 28%, p = .01).

In patients who have no concordance between radiological and clinical symptoms, the surgical levels determined by conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neurogenic examination (NE) may lead to a more extensive surgery and significant complications. We aimed to confirm that whether the use of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and paraspinal mapping (PM) techniques can further prevent the occurrence of false positives with conventional MRI, distinguish which are clinically relevant from levels of cauda equina and/or nerve root lesions based on MRI, and determine and reduce the decompression levels of lumbar spinal stenosis than MRI + NE, while ensuring or improving surgical outcomes.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: We compared the data between patients who underwent MRI + (PM or DTI) and patients who underwent conventional MRI + NE to determine levels of decompression for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis. Outcome measures were assessed at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months postoperatively.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: One hundred fourteen patients (59 in the control group, 54 in the experimental group) underwent decompression. The levels of decompression determined by MRI + (PM or DTI) in the experimental group were significantly less than that determined by MRI + NE in the control group (p = 0.000). The surgical time, blood loss, and surgical transfusion were significantly less in the experimental group (p = 0.001, p = 0.011, p = 0.001, respectively). There were no differences in improvement of the visual analog scale back and leg pain (VAS-BP, VAS-LP) scores and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after operation between the experimental and control groups.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: MRI + (PM or DTI) showed clear benefits in determining decompression levels of lumbar spinal stenosis than MRI + NE. In patients with lumbar spinal stenosis, the use of PM and DTI techniques reduces decompression levels and increases safety and benefits of surgery.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"MRI + (PM or DTI)\", \"MRI + NE\", \"Levels of decompression\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The levels of decompression determined by MRI + (PM or DTI) in the experimental group were significantly less than that determined by MRI + NE in the control group (p = 0.000).\"],\n    [\"MRI + (PM or DTI)\", \"MRI + NE\", \"Surgical time\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The surgical time, blood loss, and surgical transfusion were significantly less in the experimental group (p = 0.001, p = 0.011, p = 0.001, respectively).\"],\n    [\"MRI + (PM or DTI)\", \"MRI + NE\", \"Improvement of VAS-BP and VAS-LP scores and ODI scores\", \"no significant difference\", \"There were no differences in improvement of the visual analog scale back and leg pain (VAS-BP, VAS-LP) scores and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after operation between the experimental and control groups.\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"MRI + (PM or DTI)\", \"MRI + NE\", \"Levels of decompression\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The levels of decompression determined by MRI + (PM or DTI) in the experimental group were significantly less than that determined by MRI + NE in the control group (p = 0.000).\"],\n    [\"MRI + (PM or DTI)\", \"MRI + NE\", \"Surgical time\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The surgical time, blood loss, and surgical transfusion were significantly less in the experimental group (p = 0.001, p = 0.011, p = 0.001, respectively).\"],\n    [\"MRI + (PM or DTI)\", \"MRI + NE\", \"Improvement of VAS-BP and VAS-LP scores and ODI scores\", \"no significant difference\", \"There were no differences in improvement of the visual analog scale back and leg pain (VAS-BP, VAS-LP) scores and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after operation between the experimental and control groups.\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "a4f92d3ab883b3887fb4bcd6a35c77332ad9b80c2bcf994150e7ff03abe2e473", "prompt_hash": "ad1cdd2ac49484511a94d112f7457f7802a12dbe95427609182b129a94ed2af8", "target_hash": "96a84e9149d8e437a95a6d7953c4aaffd3267eca9481b4f4554c9ad1ff1e917b", "bypass": null}

This difference was entirely attributable to a difference between the two measures during the nocturnal period. Nocturnal gastric acid breakthrough was not a useful predictor of pathologic nocturnal esophageal reflux.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: In GERD subjects treated with a PPI, measuring time esophageal pH < 4 will significantly overestimate the prevalence of pathologic esophageal acid exposure over 24 hours and during the nocturnal period.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"integrated acidity\", \"time pH \\u003c 4\", \"the prevalence of pathologic 24-hour esophageal reflux\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The prevalence of pathologic 24-hour esophageal reflux in both studies was significantly higher when measured as time pH \\u003c 4 than when measured as integrated acidity\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

The species were randomly divided into four groups of 12 teeth in each and were treated as follows: (i) 0.1 M EDTA, (ii) 99.6% ethanol, (iii) 0.1 M EDTA followed by 99.6% ethanol and (iv) without any treatment (control). A push-out test was carried out after 24 h. Each tooth was cut into three 1 mm-thick sections. Fracture type was assessed using stereomicroscope. The data were analyzed by one way-ANOVA followed by Scheffe post-hoc test at P = 0.05.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: Almost, in EDTA and (EDTA + ethanol) every sample failed at the interface between post and lutting cement. Predominant failure mode in ethanol and control group was mixed failure. The surface treatment methods did not have any significant effect (P > 0.05) on any group but EDTA group had the highest bond strength.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: Surface treatment with (ethanol, EDTA, and EDTA + ethanol) does not significantly appear to be effective in improving the bond strength of fiber posts into root dentine. The highest bond strength was observed in EDTA group and the lowest in the control group.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Ethylene di-amine tetra-acetic acid\", \"Ethanol\", \"Bond strength\", \"no significant difference\", \"The surface treatment methods did not have any significant effect (P \\u003e 0.05) on any group but EDTA group had the highest bond strength.\"], [\"Ethylene di-amine tetra-acetic acid\", \"Ethanol\", \"Bond strength\", \"no significant difference\", \"Surface treatment with (ethanol, EDTA, and EDTA + ethanol) does not significantly appear to be effective in improving the bond strength of fiber posts into root dentine.\"], [\"Ethylene di-amine tetra-acetic acid\", \"Control\", \"Bond strength\", \"no significant difference\", \"The surface treatment methods did not have any significant effect (P \\u003e 0.05) on any group but EDTA group had the highest bond strength.\"], [\"Ethylene di-amine tetra-acetic acid + Ethanol\", \"Ethanol\", \"Bond strength\", \"no significant difference\", \"The surface treatment methods did not have any significant effect (P \\u003e 0.05) on any group but EDTA group had the highest bond strength.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

The primary outcome was transepidermal water loss (TEWL) at 14 days postbirth; the predefined difference deemed to be unimportant was 1.2. Secondary outcomes comprised changes in stratum corneum hydration, skin surface pH, clinical observations of the skin, and maternal views.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Complete TEWL data were obtained for 242 (78.8%) infants. Wash was noninferior to water alone in terms of TEWL (intention-to-treat analysis: 95% confidence interval [CI] for difference [wash–water, adjusted for family history of eczema, neonate state, and baseline] −1.24, 1.07; per protocol analysis: 95% CI −1.42, 1.09). No significant differences were found in secondary outcomes.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: We were unable to detect any differences between the newborn wash product and water.

As the sitagliptin clinical development program continues, additional studies with sitagliptin have been completed. The present analysis updates the safety and tolerability assessment of sitagliptin by examining pooled data from 25 double-blind clinical studies.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: The present analysis included data from 14,611 patients in 25 studies with T2DM who received either sitagliptin 100 mg/day (n = 7,726; sitagliptin group) or a comparator agent (n = 6,885; non-exposed group). These studies represent all randomized, double-blind trials conducted by Merck that included patients treated with the usual clinical dose of sitagliptin (100 mg/day) for between 12 weeks and 2 years, and for which results were available as of December 2011. These studies assessed sitagliptin, versus comparator agents, taken as monotherapy, initial combination therapy with metformin or pioglitazone, or as add-on combination therapy with other antihyperglycemic agents (metformin, pioglitazone, a sulfonylurea ± metformin, insulin ± metformin, or metformin + pioglitazone or rosiglitazone). Patient-level data from each study were used to evaluate between-group differences in the exposure-adjusted incidence rates of adverse events (AEs).\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Overall incidence rates of AEs and drug-related AEs were higher in the non-exposed group compared with the sitagliptin group. Incidence rates of specific AEs were generally similar between the two groups, except for higher incidence rates of hypoglycemia related to the greater use of a sulfonylurea and diarrhea related to the greater use of metformin in the non-exposed group, and of constipation in the sitagliptin group. Treatment with sitagliptin was not associated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, malignancy, or pancreatitis.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: In this updated pooled safety analysis of data from 14,611 patients with T2DM, sitagliptin 100 mg/day was generally well tolerated in clinical trials of up to 2 years in duration.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"sitagliptin 100 mg/day\", \"comparator agent\", \"The incidence rates of malignancy\", \"no significant difference\", \"Treatment with sitagliptin was not associated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, malignancy, or pancreatitis.\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:242"}, "target": "[[\"sitagliptin 100 mg/day\", \"comparator agent\", \"The incidence rates of malignancy\", \"no significant difference\", \"Treatment with sitagliptin was not associated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, malignancy, or pancreatitis.\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

A demographic checklist and a standard questionnaire covering health-promoting lifestyle, health-related QoL, self-efficacy, perceived affect, perceived social support, and perceived barriers dimensions were used to gather required data. Independent-samples t test, paired-samples t-test, and ANCOVA were used to analyze the data.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: Analysis of covariance showed that after adjusting for effects of pretest scores, the difference between mean post-test scores of health-promoting lifestyle scale, health-related QoL scale, and all constructs of Pender's health promotion model (self-efficacy, perceived affect, perceived social support, and perceived barriers) in the intervention group 1 and control group were significant (P< 0.0001). In addition, changes in mean scores of lifestyle scale (42.4 ± 13.6), QoL scale (29.1 ± 14.2), self-efficacy (16.1 ± 2.6), perceived affect (16.1 ± 8), social support (35.4 ± 12.4), and barriers (17.2 ± 15.8) before and after intervention were significant in the intervention group 2 (P < 0.0001).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:: Application of family-centered empowerment model among methamphetamine users and their families is practically feasible and can result in enhancement and improvement of their QoL, lifestyle, and health promotion model constructs.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"a group for training of methamphetamine users who were in recovery phase (intervention group 1) and control\", \"baseline\", \"mean post-test scores of health-promoting lifestyle scale, health-related QoL scale, and all constructs of Pender\\u0027s health promotion model (self-efficacy, perceived affect, perceived social support, and perceived barriers)\", \"significantly increased\", \"Analysis of covariance showed that after adjusting for effects of pretest scores, the difference between mean post-test scores of health-promoting lifestyle scale, health-related QoL scale, and all constructs of Pender\\u0027s health promotion model (self-efficacy, perceived affect, perceived social support, and perceived barriers) in the intervention group 1 and control group were significant (P\\u003c 0.0001).

Protocols of post-partum pain management should be planned based on the facilities of each center or region. The aim of current study was to compare the analgesic efficacy of oral methadone and intra muscular (IM) pethidine which the latter was routinely used in our center in post cesarean pain treatment.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:: In this prospective double-blind clinical trial, women who were candidate for cesarean section were selected and randomized into two groups. All patients routinely received a single IM pethidine dose (50 mg) after CS in the recovery room. One group of patients received 0.7 mg/kg pethidine every 6 hour IM, and another group received 0.07 mg/kg oral methadone every 6 hour. Severity of pain assessed using visual analogue scale (VAS) score in 6, 12, 18 and 24 hour after surgery.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: Pain severity in methadone group at 6, 12, 18 and 24 hour post operation were 6.4 ± 0.9, 3.4 ± 0.8, 1.9 ± 1.1, 0.5 ± 0.5 (p < 0.05) and for patients in pethidine group were 6.6 ± 0.8, 3.4 ± 0.9, 2.1 ± 1.0 and 0.5 ± 0.5 (p < 0.05), respectively (Mean ± SD).

This suggests a gap in knowledge for persons with OA regarding the many different treatments available to them.\n\nABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate outcomes after usage of a Web-based resource called My Joint Pain that contains tailored, evidence-based information and tools aimed to improve self-management of OA on self-management and change in knowledge.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: A quasi-experimental design was used to evaluate the My Joint Pain website intervention over a 12-month period. The intervention provided participants with general and user-specific information, monthly assessments with validated instruments, and progress-tracking tools. A nationwide convenience sample of 195 participants with self-assessed hip and/or knee OA completed both baseline and 12-month questionnaires (users: n=104; nonusers: n=91). The primary outcome measure was the Health Evaluation Impact Questionnaire (heiQ) to evaluate 8 different domains (health-directed activity, positive and active engagement in life, emotional distress, self-monitoring and insight, constructive attitudes and approaches, skill and technique acquisition, social integration and support, health service navigation) and the secondary outcome measure was the 17-item Osteoarthritis Quality Indicator (OAQI) questionnaire to evaluate the change in appropriateness of care received by participants. Independent t tests were used to compare changes between groups for the heiQ and chi-square tests to identify changes within and between groups from baseline to 12 months for each OAQI item.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Baseline demographics between groups were similar for gender (152/195, 77.9% female), age (mean 60, SD 9 years) and body mass index (mean 31.1, SD 6.8 kg/m2). With the exception of health service navigation, mean effect sizes from all other heiQ domains showed a positive trend for My Joint Pain users compared to the nonusers, although the differences between groups did not reach statistical significance. Within-group changes also showed improvements among the users of the My Joint Pain website for self-management (absolute change score=15%, P=.03), lifestyle (absolute change score=16%, P=.02), and physical activity (absolute change score=11%, P=.04), with no significant improvements for the nonusers. Following 12 months of exposure to the website, there were significant improvements for users compared to nonusers in self-management (absolute change score 15% vs 2%, P=.001) and weight reduction (absolute change scores 3% vs –6%, P=.03) measured on the OAQI.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: The My Joint Pain Web resource does not significantly improve overall heiQ, but does improve other important aspects of quality of care in people with hip and/or knee OA. Further work is required to improve engagement with the website and the quality of information delivered in order to provide a greater impact.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Website users\", \"Nonusers\", \"Self-management as measured on the OAQI, after 12 months\", \"significantly increased\", \"Following 12 months of exposure to the website, there were significant improvements for users compared to nonusers in self-management (absolute change score 15% vs 2%, P=.001) and weight reduction (absolute change scores 3% vs \\u20136%, P=.03) measured on the OAQI.\"], [\"Website users\", \"Nonusers\", \"Domains examined for the heiQ\", \"no significant difference\", \"With the exception of health service navigation, mean effect sizes from all other heiQ domains showed a positive trend for My Joint Pain users compared to the nonusers, although the differences between groups did not reach statistical significance.\"], [\"Website users\", \"Nonusers\", \"Weight reduction as measured on the OAQI, after 12 months\", \"significantly increased\", \"Following 12 months of exposure to the website, there were significant improvements for users compared to nonusers in self-management (absolute change score 15% vs 2%, P=.001) and weight reduction (absolute change scores 3% vs \\u20136%, P=.03) measured on the OAQI.\"], [\"Website users\", \"Nonusers\", \"Baseline demographics\", \"no significant difference\", \"Baseline demographics between groups were similar for gender (152/195, 77.9% female), age (mean 60, SD 9 years) and body mass index (mean 31.1, SD 6.8 kg/m2).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Protocols of post-partum pain management should be planned based on the facilities of each center or region. The aim of current study was to compare the analgesic efficacy of oral methadone and intra muscular (IM) pethidine which the latter was routinely used in our center in post cesarean pain treatment.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:: In this prospective double-blind clinical trial, women who were candidate for cesarean section were selected and randomized into two groups. All patients routinely received a single IM pethidine dose (50 mg) after CS in the recovery room. One group of patients received 0.7 mg/kg pethidine every 6 hour IM, and another group received 0.07 mg/kg oral methadone every 6 hour. Severity of pain assessed using visual analogue scale (VAS) score in 6, 12, 18 and 24 hour after surgery.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: Pain severity in methadone group at 6, 12, 18 and 24 hour post operation were 6.4 ± 0.9, 3.4 ± 0.8, 1.9 ± 1.1, 0.5 ± 0.5 (p < 0.05) and for patients in pethidine group were 6.6 ± 0.8, 3.4 ± 0.9, 2.1 ± 1.0 and 0.5 ± 0.5 (p < 0.05), respectively (Mean ± SD). Between groups differences in each follow up time were not statistically significant. There was no difference between groups in terms of complications and supplementary analgesic use.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: Considering the similar analgesic effects of methadone and pethidine, satisfaction of patients and nursing system with methadone use and the cost benefit of methadone, it can be recommended to use methadone for post operative pain relieving.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[[\"oral methadone\", \"intra muscular pethidine\", \"pain severity as measured by VAS score\", \"no significant difference\", \"Between groups differences in each follow up time were not statistically significant.\"], [\"oral methadone\", \"intra muscular pethidine\", \"complications and supplementary analgesic use\", \"no significant difference\", \"There was no difference between groups in terms of complications and supplementary analgesic use.\"]]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[[\"oral methadone\", \"intra muscular pethidine\", \"pain severity as measured by VAS score\", \"no significant difference\", \"Between groups differences in each follow up time were not statistically significant.\"], [\"oral methadone\", \"intra muscular pethidine\", \"complications and supplementary analgesic use\", \"no significant difference\", \"There was no difference between groups in terms of complications and supplementary analgesic use.\"]]"], "doc_hash": "6bdb839f1bc505172b0a7a96ea8053a4add6a5737f3d90fd44df7adcb83d1631", "prompt_hash": "81df00b7469268c6553147b676f63d4be62f47a4da3e2eada7f8a58b0bff720a", "target_hash": "1c08fb861ca4cbc5f5ab9208675f572df2e3cd4e74bccb3d5b6135b01e4bb1c6", "bypass": null}

Infertile women may experience severe stress and depression. Numerous studies have indicated that auriculotherapy could reduce stress. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine the effect of auriculotherapy on the stress and the outcome assisted reproductive technology in infertile women.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:: The present study was a clinical trial that was conducted on 56 infertile women aged 20–45, who were assigned into two groups of intervention and control, from November 2014 to November 2015. The control group only received the routine treatments, while the intervention group, in addition to their routine treatment, received auriculotherapy for 8–10 sessions during menstrual cycle. Both groups completed Newton's Fertility Problem Inventory in three stages. The datasets collected for the study were analyzed using independent t-test, repeated-measures analysis of variance, and Chi-square test.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: The mean score of stress in the intervention group decreased significantly, compared to the control group prior to the embryo transfer and pregnancy test stages.

This analysis examined pooled efficacy data as reflected in cumulative pain scores from 10 randomized, double-blind liposome bupivacaine clinical studies in which the study drug was administered via local wound infiltration.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: A total of 823 patients were exposed to liposome bupivacaine in 10 local wound infiltration studies at doses ranging from 66 mg to 532 mg in five surgical settings; 446 patients received bupivacaine HCl (dose: 75–200 mg) and 190 received placebo. Efficacy measures were assessed through 72 hours after surgery.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Overall, 45% of patients were male and 19% were ≥65 years of age. In the analysis of cumulative pain intensity scores through 72 hours, liposome bupivacaine was associated with lower pain scores than the comparator in 16 of 19 treatment arms assessed, achieving statistically significant differences compared with bupivacaine HCl (P < 0.05) in five of 17 treatment arms. These results were supported by results of other efficacy measures, including time to first use of opioid rescue medication, proportion of patients avoiding opioid rescue medication, total postsurgical consumption of opioid rescue medication, and patient/care provider satisfaction with postoperative analgesia. Local infiltration of liposome bupivacaine resulted in significant systemic plasma levels of bupivacaine, which could persist for 96 hours; systemic plasma levels of bupivacaine following administration of liposome bupivacaine were not correlated with local efficacy. Liposome bupivacaine and bupivacaine HCl were generally well tolerated.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Based on this integrated analysis of multiple efficacy measures, liposome bupivacaine appears to be a potentially useful therapeutic option for prolonged reduction of postsurgical pain in soft tissue and orthopedic surgeries.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"liposome bupivacaine\", \"bupivacaine HCl\", \"cumulative pain\", \"significantly decreased\", \"In the analysis of cumulative pain intensity scores through 72 hours, liposome bupivacaine was associated with lower pain scores than the comparator in 16 of 19 treatment arms assessed, achieving statistically significant differences compared with bupivacaine HCl (P \\u003c 0.05) in five of 17 treatment arms\"], [\"liposome bupivacaine 266 mg \", \"placebo\", \"\\\"satisfied\\ufffd or \\\"extremely satisfied\\ufffd with their postoperative analgesia at 24 hours after surgery\", \"significantly increased\", \"At 24 hours after surgery in this study, 95% of patients in the liposome bupivacaine 266 mg group were \\\"satisfied\\\" or \\\"extremely satisfied\\\" with their postoperative analgesia compared with 72% in the placebo group (P = 0.0007). \"], [\"liposome bupivacaine 266 mg \", \"placebo\", \"\\\"satisfied\\ufffd or \\\"extremely satisfied\\ufffd with their postoperative analgesia at 72 hours after surgery\", \"significantly increased\", \"At 24 hours after surgery in this study, 95% of patients in the liposome bupivacaine 266 mg group were \\\"satisfied\\\" or \\\"extremely satisfied\\\" with their postoperative analgesia compared with 72% in the placebo group (P = 0.0007).

Oral hygiene practices among visually impaired children require a special approach with time and patience. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of oral health education and fluoridated dentifrices on the oral health status of visually impaired children.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:: Fifty visually impaired children between 8 and 12 years of age formed the study group. Oral health education and motivation was done with the help of Braille. Modified Bass method of brushing was taught to the children and the required dental treatment was done. Subjects were randomly divided into two equal groups fluoridated and non-fluoridated. Oral hygiene index -simplified, DMFT, deft index, and Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus count were assessed at baseline, immediately after the treatment and at 3, 6, and 12 month intervals. The oral health awareness was assessed using a questionnaire at the beginning and end of the study.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: At baseline, the mean OHI-S, DMFT and deft scores were 2.72, 0.47, and 0.51 respectively. At the end of 12 months there was a significant decrease in OHI-S scores in the fluoridated group. No significant difference was seen in DMFT and deft between the fluoridated and non-fluoridated groups at the different time interval. After the oral health education and comprehensive treatment there was a reduction in Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus counts in both groups; however, at the end of 3, 6, 12 months there was a significant decrease in fluoridated group as compared to the non-fluoridated. The oral health awareness increased significantly at the end of the study.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: The oral health education and motivation formulated for the visually impaired children was effective in improving their oral health status.

The objective of this study was to examine whether implementation of a standardized emergency department (ED) protocol improves the quality of syncope evaluation.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a prospective, non-randomized study conducted at a 1900-bed, tertiary teaching hospital in South Korea. We compared two specific periods, including a 12-month observation period (control group, January-December 2009) and a 10-month intervention period after the implementation of standardized approaches, comprising risk stratification, hospital order sets and establishment of a syncope observational unit (intervention group, March-December 2010). Primary end points were hospital admission rates and medical costs related to syncope evaluation.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: A total of 244 patients were enrolled in this study (116 patients in the control group and 128 patients in the intervention group). The admission rate decreased by 8.3% in the intervention group (adjusted odds ratio 0.31, 95% confidence interval 0.13-0.70, p=0.005). There was a cost reduction of about 30% during the intervention period [369000 Korean won (KRW), interquartile range (IQR) 240000-602000 KRW], compared with the control period (542000 KRW, IQR 316000-1185000 KRW). The length of stay in the ED was also reduced in the intervention group (median: 4.6 hours vs. 3.4 hours).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Standardized approaches to syncope evaluation reduced hospital admissions, medical costs and length of stay in the overcrowded emergency department of a tertiary teaching hospital in South Korea.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Educational program and ED protocol for syncope evaluation\", \"No standardized guidelines or educational programs\", \"Admission rate\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The admission rate decreased by 8.3% in the intervention group (adjusted odds ratio 0.31, 95% confidence interval 0.13-0.70, p=0.005).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Oral hygiene practices among visually impaired children require a special approach with time and patience. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of oral health education and fluoridated dentifrices on the oral health status of visually impaired children.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:: Fifty visually impaired children between 8 and 12 years of age formed the study group. Oral health education and motivation was done with the help of Braille. Modified Bass method of brushing was taught to the children and the required dental treatment was done. Subjects were randomly divided into two equal groups fluoridated and non-fluoridated. Oral hygiene index -simplified, DMFT, deft index, and Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus count were assessed at baseline, immediately after the treatment and at 3, 6, and 12 month intervals. The oral health awareness was assessed using a questionnaire at the beginning and end of the study.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: At baseline, the mean OHI-S, DMFT and deft scores were 2.72, 0.47, and 0.51 respectively. At the end of 12 months there was a significant decrease in OHI-S scores in the fluoridated group. No significant difference was seen in DMFT and deft between the fluoridated and non-fluoridated groups at the different time interval. After the oral health education and comprehensive treatment there was a reduction in Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus counts in both groups; however, at the end of 3, 6, 12 months there was a significant decrease in fluoridated group as compared to the non-fluoridated. The oral health awareness increased significantly at the end of the study.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: The oral health education and motivation formulated for the visually impaired children was effective in improving their oral health status. Fluoridated dentifrices decreased the Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus counts and improved the oral hygiene status.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[[\"Oral health education and fluoridated dentifrices\", \"Non-fluoridated dentifrices\", \"Oral hygiene index -simplified (OHI-S)\", \"significantly decreased\", \"At the end of 12 months there was a significant decrease in OHI-S scores in the fluoridated group.\"], [\"Oral health education and fluoridated dentifrices\", \"Non-fluoridated dentifrices\", \"Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus counts\", \"significantly decreased\", \"At the end of 3, 6, 12 months there was a significant decrease in fluoridated group as compared to the non-fluoridated.\"]]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[[\"Oral health education and fluoridated dentifrices\", \"Non-fluoridated dentifrices\", \"Oral hygiene index -simplified (OHI-S)\", \"significantly decreased\", \"At the end of 12 months there was a significant decrease in OHI-S scores in the fluoridated group.\"], [\"Oral health education and fluoridated dentifrices\", \"Non-fluoridated dentifrices\", \"Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus counts\", \"significantly decreased\", \"At the end of 3, 6, 12 months there was a significant decrease in fluoridated group as compared to the non-fluoridated.\"]]"], "doc_hash": "88a0a72c98e42f706bf8ed17cdda150ce29c0c35d2f2b5a2ba76c5710b9ac498", "prompt_hash": "b1766b299dc72bf0debb4a495acb04ab17a1c2f288c1356a91cc5c84d2aa0185", "target_hash": "8a9aece030b208d02b5d82ab1cab41e86300033ed625cc2554b07a2ccf6d568d", "bypass": null}

Because of the chronic nature of the disease, self-care is necessary. Education alone is not effective in providing care. Misunderstanding by the patients regarding diabetes during the training programs render telephone follow-up after training essential.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:: This quasi-experimental study with two groups (experimental and control) was conducted in two phases in 2014. The study population consisted of 70 children of 10–18 years of age with type I diabetes (35 patients in the experimental group and 35 in the control group). The participants were randomly selected from the patients referring to the Sedigheh Tahereh Diabetic Research and Treatment Center in Isfahan, Iran. Data were collected using a researcher-made questionnaire on self-care and a glycosylated hemoglobin recording form. The experimental group received 12 weeks of telephone follow-up training by the center, whereas the control group received no follow-up.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: The results showed that, after intervention, the total mean score of self-care in all aspects of diabetes care for children was significantly higher in the experimental group (p < 0.001). In addition, a statistically significant difference was observed between the experimental and control groups in terms of mean glycosylated hemoglobin after the intervention (p = 0.030).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:: It can be concluded that telephone follow-up by a nurse can improve total self-care and glycosylated hemoglobin in patients with type I diabetes.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"12 weeks of telephone follow-up training by the center\", \"no follow-up\", \"the mean score of self-care\", \"significantly increased\", \"after intervention, the total mean score of self-care in all aspects of diabetes care for children was significantly higher in the experimental group (p \\u003c 0.001)\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

The efficacy and safety of axitinib in Japanese patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma were evaluated.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: A subgroup analysis was conducted in Japanese patients enrolled in the randomized Phase III trial of axitinib versus sorafenib after failure of one prior systemic therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Twenty-five (of 361) and 29 (of 362) patients randomized to the axitinib and sorafenib arms, respectively, were Japanese and included in this analysis. Median progression-free survival in Japanese patients was 12.1 months (95% confidence interval 8.6 to not estimable) for axitinib and 4.9 months (95% confidence interval 2.8–6.6) for sorafenib (hazard ratio 0.390; 95% confidence interval 0.130–1.173; stratified one-sided P = 0.0401). The objective response rate was 52.0% for axitinib and 3.4% for sorafenib (P = 0.0001). The common all-causality adverse events (all grades) in Japanese patients were dysphonia (68%), hypertension (64%), hand–foot syndrome (64%) and diarrhea (56%) for axitinib, and hand–foot syndrome (86%), hypertension (62%) and diarrhea (52%) for sorafenib. The safety profiles of axitinib and sorafenib in Japanese patients were generally similar to those observed in the overall population, with the exceptions of higher incidences of hypertension, dysphonia, hand–foot syndrome, hypothyroidism and stomatitis.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Axitinib is efficacious and well tolerated in Japanese patients with previously treated metastatic renal cell carcinoma, consistent with the results in the overall population, providing a new targeted therapy for these Japanese patients.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"axitinib\", \"sorafenib\", \"Median progression-free survival\", \"significantly increased\", \"Median progression-free survival in Japanese patients was 12.1 months (95% confidence interval 8.6 to not estimable) for axitinib and 4.9 months (95% confidence interval 2.8\\u20136.6) for sorafenib (hazard ratio 0.390; 95% confidence interval 0.130\\u20131.173; stratified one-sided P = 0.0401).\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:247"}, "target": "[[\"axitinib\", \"sorafenib\", \"Median progression-free survival\", \"significantly increased\", \"Median progression-free survival in Japanese patients was 12.1 months (95% confidence interval 8.6 to not estimable) for axitinib and 4.9 months (95% confidence interval 2.8\\u20136.6) for sorafenib (hazard ratio 0.390; 95% confidence interval 0.130\\u20131.173; stratified one-sided P = 0.0401).\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

The aim of this case-controlled study was to investigate if vitamin D supplementation could improve pain management, quality of life (QoL) and decrease infections in palliative cancer patients.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Thirty-nine palliative cancer patients with levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 75 nmol/L were supplemented with vitamin D 4000 IE/day, and were compared to 39 untreated, matched \"control\"-patients from a previous study at the same ward. Opioid doses, antibiotic consumption and QoL-scores measured with the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) were monitored. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline after 1 and 3 months compared between the groups using linear regression with adjustment for a potential cofounding factor.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: After 1 month the vitamin D treated group had a significantly decreased fentanyl dose compared to the untreated group with a difference of 46 μg/h; 95% CI 24–78, which increased further at 3 months to 91 μg/h; 95% CI 56–140 μg/h. The ESAS QoL-score improved in the Vitamin D group the first month; -1.4; 95% CI -2.6 - (-0.21). The vitamin D-treated group had significantly lower consumption of antibiotics after 3 months compared to the untreated group, the difference was -26%; 95%CI -0.41%–(-0.12%). Vitamin D was well tolerated by all patients and no adverse events were reported.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Vitamin D supplementation to palliative cancer patients is safe and improvement in pain management is noted as early as 1 month after treatment. Decreased infections are noted 3 months after vitamin D treatment. The results from this pilot-study have been used for the power-calculation of a future randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study called \"Palliative-D\" that will start in Nov 2017 and will include 254 palliative cancer patients.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"vitamin D 4000 IE/day\", \"untreated (control)\", \"fentanyl dose after 1 month and 3 months\", \"significantly decreased\", \"After 1 month the vitamin D treated group had a significantly decreased fentanyl dose compared to the untreated group with a difference of 46 \\u03bcg/h; 95% CI 24\\u201378, which increased further at 3 months to 91 \\u03bcg/h; 95% CI 56\\u2013140 \\u03bcg/h.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

The efficacy and safety of axitinib in Japanese patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma were evaluated.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: A subgroup analysis was conducted in Japanese patients enrolled in the randomized Phase III trial of axitinib versus sorafenib after failure of one prior systemic therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Twenty-five (of 361) and 29 (of 362) patients randomized to the axitinib and sorafenib arms, respectively, were Japanese and included in this analysis. Median progression-free survival in Japanese patients was 12.1 months (95% confidence interval 8.6 to not estimable) for axitinib and 4.9 months (95% confidence interval 2.8–6.6) for sorafenib (hazard ratio 0.390; 95% confidence interval 0.130–1.173; stratified one-sided P = 0.0401). The objective response rate was 52.0% for axitinib and 3.4% for sorafenib (P = 0.0001). The common all-causality adverse events (all grades) in Japanese patients were dysphonia (68%), hypertension (64%), hand–foot syndrome (64%) and diarrhea (56%) for axitinib, and hand–foot syndrome (86%), hypertension (62%) and diarrhea (52%) for sorafenib. The safety profiles of axitinib and sorafenib in Japanese patients were generally similar to those observed in the overall population, with the exceptions of higher incidences of hypertension, dysphonia, hand–foot syndrome, hypothyroidism and stomatitis.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Axitinib is efficacious and well tolerated in Japanese patients with previously treated metastatic renal cell carcinoma, consistent with the results in the overall population, providing a new targeted therapy for these Japanese patients.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[[\"axitinib\", \"sorafenib\", \"progression-free survival\", \"significantly increased\", \"Median progression-free survival in Japanese patients was 12.1 months (95% confidence interval 8.6 to not estimable) for axitinib and 4.9 months (95% confidence interval 2.8–6.6) for sorafenib (hazard ratio 0.390; 95% confidence interval 0.130–1.173; stratified one-sided P = 0.0401).\"], [\"axitinib\", \"sorafenib\", \"objective response rate\", \"significantly increased\", \"The objective response rate was 52.0% for axitinib and 3.4% for sorafenib (P = 0.0001).\"]]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[[\"axitinib\", \"sorafenib\", \"progression-free survival\", \"significantly increased\", \"Median progression-free survival in Japanese patients was 12.1 months (95% confidence interval 8.6 to not estimable) for axitinib and 4.9 months (95% confidence interval 2.8–6.6) for sorafenib (hazard ratio 0.390; 95% confidence interval 0.130–1.173; stratified one-sided P = 0.0401).\"], [\"axitinib\", \"sorafenib\", \"objective response rate\", \"significantly increased\", \"The objective response rate was 52.0% for axitinib and 3.4% for sorafenib (P = 0.0001).\"]]"], "doc_hash": "6e781a50d57091fb3f0ec3835466c9fc64d75065eaeb9d157163131689d8ed88", "prompt_hash": "35655f6059670467817479e0b476dc5b88e9eb7c11ab5e4864faf959785df4c4", "target_hash": "7ef33acb1f3c0ea640b7fba2392c42031937f7f12979f7a0fd60344af4f551a7", "bypass": null}

Although ischemic postconditioning possessed a wide prospect of clinical application, debates on the precise ischemic postconditioning algorithm to use in clinical settings were ongoing. In this regard, pharmacological strategies were possible alternative methods. Accumulating data demonstrated that pharmacological postconditioning with morphine conferred cardioprotection in animals. This trial aimed to evaluate the effect of morphine-induced postconditioning on protection against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in patients undergoing corrections of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF).\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Eight-nine consecutive children scheduled for corrections of TOF were enrolled and randomly assigned to either a postconditioning group (patients received a dose of morphine (0.1 mg/kg) injected via a cardioplegia needle into the aortic root for direct and focused delivery to the heart within 1 minute starting at 3 min before aorta cross-clamp removal, n=44) or a control group (the same protocol was performed as in the postconditioning group except that patients received the same volume of saline instead, n=45). The peri-operative relevant data were investigated and analyzed, and the cardiac troponin I (cTnI) was assayed preoperatively, and then 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, 24 h and 48 h after reperfusion.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Morphine-induced postconditioning reduced postoperative peak cTnI release as compared to the control group (0.57 ± 0.15 versus 0.75 ± 0.20 ng/mL, p<0.0001). Morphine-induced postconditioned patients had lower peak inotropic score (5.7 ± 2.4 versus 8.4 ± 3.6, p<0.0001) and shorter duration of mechanical ventilation as well as ICU stay (20.6 ± 6.8 versus 28.5 ± 8.3 hours, p<0.0001 and 40.4 ± 10.3 versus 57.8 ± 15.2 hours, p<0.0001, respectively), while higher left ventricular ejection fraction as well as cardiac output (0.57±0.15 versus 0.51±0.13, p=0.0467 and 1.39 ± 0.25 versus 1.24 ± 0.21 L/min, p=0.0029, respectively) as compared to the control group during the first postoperative 24 hours.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Morphine-induced postconditioning may provide enhanced cardioprotection against ischemia/reperfusion injury in children undergoing corrections of TOF.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"morphine (0.1 mg/kg) injected via a cardioplegia needle into the aortic root\", \"control group (the same protocol was performed as in the postconditioning group except that patients received the same volume of saline instead\", \"postoperative peak cTnI release\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Morphine-induced postconditioning reduced postoperative peak cTnI release as compared to the control group (0.57 \\u00b1 0.15 versus 0.75 \\u00b1 0.20 ng/mL, p\\u0026lt;0.0001).\"], [\"morphine (0.1 mg/kg) injected via a cardioplegia needle into the aortic root\", \"control group (the same protocol was performed as in the postconditioning group except that patients received the same volume of saline instead\", \"postoperative peak cTnI release\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Morphine-induced postconditioning reduced postoperative peak cTnI release as compared to the control group (0.57 \\u00b1 0.15 versus 0.75 \\u00b1 0.20 ng/mL, p\\u003c0.0001).\"], [\"morphine (0.1 mg/kg) injected via a cardioplegia needle into the aortic root\", \"control group (the same protocol was performed as in the postconditioning group except that patients received the same volume of saline instead\", \"peak inotropic score ; duration of mechanical ventilation as well as ICU stay\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Morphine-induced postconditioned patients had lower peak inotropic score (5.7 \\u00b1 2.4 versus 8.4 \\u00b1 3.6, p\\u0026lt;0.0001) and shorter duration of mechanical ventilation as well as ICU stay (20.6 \\u00b1 6.8 versus 28.5 \\u00b1 8.3 hours, p\\u0026lt;0.0001 and 40.4 \\u00b1 10.3 versus 57.8 \\u00b1 15.2 hours, p\\u0026lt;0.0001, respectively)\"], [\"morphine (0.1 mg/kg) injected via a cardioplegia needle into the aortic root\", \"control group (the same protocol was performed as in the postconditioning group except that patients received the same volume of saline instead\", \"peak inotropic score ; duration of mechanical ventilation as well as ICU stay\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Morphine-induced postconditioned patients had lower peak inotropic score (5.7 \\u00b1 2.4 versus 8.4 \\u00b1 3.6, p\\u003c0.0001) and shorter duration of mechanical ventilation as well as ICU stay (20.6 \\u00b1 6.8 versus 28.5 \\u00b1 8.3 hours, p\\u003c0.0001 and 40.4 \\u00b1 10.3 versus 57.8 \\u00b1 15.2 hours, p\\u003c0.0001, respectively),\"], [\"morphine (0.1 mg/kg) injected via a cardioplegia needle into the aortic root\", \"control group (the same protocol was performed as in the postconditioning group except that patients received the same volume of saline instead\", \"left ventricular ejection fraction; cardiac output\", \"significantly increased\", \"while higher left ventricular ejection fraction as well as cardiac output (0.57\\u00b10.15 versus 0.51\\u00b10.13, p=0.0467 and 1.39 \\u00b1 0.25 versus 1.24 \\u00b1 0.21 L/min, p=0.0029, respectively) as compared to the control group during the first postoperative 24 hours.\"], [\"morphine (0.1 mg/kg) injected via a cardioplegia needle into the aortic root\", \"control group (the same protocol was performed as in the postconditioning group except that patients received the same volume of saline instead\", \"left ventricular ejection fraction; cardiac output\", \"significantly increased\", \".

These neonates should reach an independent oral nutrition stage before being discharged from the Neonatal Intensive care Unit. Therefore, the researcher decided to conduct a study on the effect of palady and cup feeding on premature neonates' weight gain and their reaching full oral feeding time interval.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:: This is a clinical trial with a quantitative design conducted on 69 premature infants (gestational age between 29 and 32 weeks) who were assigned to cup (n = 34) and palady (n = 35) feeding groups through random allocation. The first feeding was administrated either by cup or palady method in each shift within seven sequential days (total of 21 cup and palady feedings). Then, the rest of feeding was administrated by gavage.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: Mean hospitalization time (cup = 39.01 and palady = 30.4; P < 0.001) and mean time interval to reach full oral feeding (cup = 33.7 and palady = 24.1; P < 0.001) were significantly lower in palady group compared to cup group. Mean weight changes of neonates 7 weeks after the intervention compared to those in the beginning of the intervention were significantly more in palady group compared to the cup group (cup = 146.7 and palady = 198.8; P < 0.001).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:: The neonates in palady group reached full oral feeding earlier than those of cup group.

No trial has previously examined whether exercising to neutral or into the hypermobile range affects outcomes. This study aimed to (i) determine if a physiotherapist-prescribed exercise programme focused on knee joint strength and control is effective in reducing knee pain in children with JHS compared to no treatment, and (ii) whether the range in which these exercises are performed affects outcomes.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: A prospective, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial conducted in a tertiary hospital in Sydney, Australia compared an 8 week exercise programme performed into either the full hypermobile range or only to neutral knee extension, following a minimum 2 week baseline period without treatment. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealed by sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes. Knee pain was the primary outcome. Quality of life, thigh muscle strength, and function were also measured at (i) initial assessment, (ii) following the baseline period and (iii) post treatment. Assessors were blinded to the participants' treatment allocation and participants blinded to the difference in the treatments.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Children with JHS and knee pain (n=26) aged 7-16 years were randomly assigned to the hypermobile (n=12) or neutral (n=14) treatment group. Significant improvements in child-reported maximal knee pain were found following treatment, regardless of group allocation with a mean 14.5 mm reduction on the visual analogue scale (95% CI 5.2 – 23.8 mm, p=0.003). Significant differences between treatment groups were noted for parent-reported overall psychosocial health (p=0.009), specifically self-esteem (p=0.034), mental health (p=0.001) and behaviour (p=0.019), in favour of exercising into the hypermobile range (n=11) compared to neutral only (n=14). Conversely, parent-reported overall physical health significantly favoured exercising only to neutral (p=0.037). No other differences were found between groups and no adverse events occurred.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Parents perceive improved child psychosocial health when children exercise into the hypermobile range, while exercising to neutral only is perceived to favour the child's physical health.

We performed the following: an intensive individual intervention (III), an intensive group intervention (IGI) and a minimal intervention (MI). Included in the study were smokers who were prepared to quit smoking. Excluded from the study were individuals aged less than 18 years or with severe mental conditions or terminal illnesses. The outcome measure was continued abstinence at 12 months confirmed through CO-oximetry (CO). The analysis was based on intention to treat.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: In total, 287 smokers were recruited: 81 in the III, 111 in the IGI, and 95 in the MI. Continued abstinence at 12 months confirmed through CO was 7.4% in the III, 5.4% in the IGI, and 1% in the MI. No significant differences were noted between III and MI on the one hand, and between IGI and MI on the other [RR 7.04 (0.9-7.2) and RR 5.1 (0.6-41.9), respectively]. No differences were noted between IGI and III [RR 0.7 (0.2-2.2)]. In multivariate analysis, only overall visit length showed a statistically significant association with smoking cessation.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of intensive smoking interventions in this study was lower than expected.

SASA!, a phased community mobilization intervention, engages communities to prevent IPV and promote gender equity. The SASA! study assessed the community-level impact of SASA! on reported HIV-related risk behaviours and relationship dynamics.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Data were collected as part of a cluster randomized controlled trial conducted between 2007 and 2012 in eight communities in Kampala. An adjusted cluster-level intention to treat analysis, compares secondary outcomes in intervention and control communities at follow-up. The qualitative evaluation explored participants' subjective experience of SASA!. A total of 82 in-depth interviews were audio recorded at follow-up, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Men in intervention communities were significantly more likely than controls to report a broad range of HIV-protective behaviours, including higher levels of condom use (aRR 2.03, 95% CI 1.22–3.39), HIV testing (aRR 1.50, 95% CI 1.13–2.00) and fewer concurrent partners (aRR 0.60, 95% CI 0.37–0.97). They were also more likely to report increased joint decision-making (aRR 1.92, 95% CI 1.27–2.91), greater male participation in household tasks (aRR 1.48, 95% CI 1.09–2.01), more open communication and greater appreciation of their partner's work inside (aRR 1.31, 95% CI 1.04–1.66) and outside (aRR 1.49, 95% CI 1.08–2.06) the home. For women, all outcomes were in the hypothesized direction, but effect sizes were smaller. Only some achieved statistical significance. Women in intervention communities were significantly more likely to report being able to refuse sex with their partners (aRR 1.16, 95% CI 1.00–1.35), joint decision-making (aRR 1.37, 95% CI 1.06–1.78) and more open communication on a number of indicators. Qualitative interviews suggest that shifts operated through broader improvements in relationships, including increased trust and cooperation, participants' greater awareness of the connections between HIV and IPV and their resultant desire to improve their relationships. Barriers to change include partial uptake of SASA!, partner resistance, fear and entrenched previous beliefs.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: SASA! impacted positively on reported HIV-related risk behaviours and relationship dynamics at a community level, especially among men.

The efficacy and safety of oral bisphosphonates for the treatment of osteoporosis are well established. However, patient adherence and persistence on treatment are suboptimal. This randomised open-label multi-centre study of 6-months' duration compared persistence on treatment in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis receiving either once-monthly ibandronate plus a patient support programme (PSP), or once-weekly alendronate. To avoid falsely elevated persistence rates often associated with clinical trials, the study was designed to reflect everyday clinical practice in the UK and follow-up visits were limited to be consistent with the primary care setting. Analysis of the primary endpoint showed that persistence was significantly higher in the ibandronate/PSP group compared with the alendronate group (p < 0.0001). The estimated proportion of patients persisting with treatment at 6 months was 56.6% (306/541) and 38.6% (198/513) in the ibandronate/PSP and alendronate groups, respectively. Therefore, compared with alendronate, there was a 47% relative improvement in the proportion of patients persisting with treatment in the ibandronate/PSP group. Secondary endpoint measurements of adherence (e.g. proportion of patients remaining on treatment at study end; proportion of patients discontinuing from the study) were also significantly different in favour of ibandronate plus patient support. In summary, the PERSIST study demonstrated that persistence on treatment was increased in patients receiving once-monthly ibandronate plus patient support compared with once-weekly alendronate. Increased persistence on bisphosphonate treatment is expected to improve patient outcomes and decrease the social and economic burden of osteoporosis.\n\nFindings:\n[[\" ibandronate plus a patient support programme (PSP)\", \"alendronate\", \"persistence on treatment\", \"significantly increased\", \"Analysis of the primary endpoint showed that persistence was significantly higher in the ibandronate/PSP group compared with the alendronate group (p \\u003c 0.0001).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

SASA!, a phased community mobilization intervention, engages communities to prevent IPV and promote gender equity. The SASA! study assessed the community-level impact of SASA! on reported HIV-related risk behaviours and relationship dynamics.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Data were collected as part of a cluster randomized controlled trial conducted between 2007 and 2012 in eight communities in Kampala. An adjusted cluster-level intention to treat analysis, compares secondary outcomes in intervention and control communities at follow-up. The qualitative evaluation explored participants' subjective experience of SASA!. A total of 82 in-depth interviews were audio recorded at follow-up, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Men in intervention communities were significantly more likely than controls to report a broad range of HIV-protective behaviours, including higher levels of condom use (aRR 2.03, 95% CI 1.22–3.39), HIV testing (aRR 1.50, 95% CI 1.13–2.00) and fewer concurrent partners (aRR 0.60, 95% CI 0.37–0.97). They were also more likely to report increased joint decision-making (aRR 1.92, 95% CI 1.27–2.91), greater male participation in household tasks (aRR 1.48, 95% CI 1.09–2.01), more open communication and greater appreciation of their partner's work inside (aRR 1.31, 95% CI 1.04–1.66) and outside (aRR 1.49, 95% CI 1.08–2.06) the home. For women, all outcomes were in the hypothesized direction, but effect sizes were smaller. Only some achieved statistical significance. Women in intervention communities were significantly more likely to report being able to refuse sex with their partners (aRR 1.16, 95% CI 1.00–1.35), joint decision-making (aRR 1.37, 95% CI 1.06–1.78) and more open communication on a number of indicators. Qualitative interviews suggest that shifts operated through broader improvements in relationships, including increased trust and cooperation, participants' greater awareness of the connections between HIV and IPV and their resultant desire to improve their relationships. Barriers to change include partial uptake of SASA!, partner resistance, fear and entrenched previous beliefs.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: SASA! impacted positively on reported HIV-related risk behaviours and relationship dynamics at a community level, especially among men. Social change programmes focusing on IPV and gender equity could play an important role in HIV prevention efforts.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"SASA! intervention\", \"control communities\", \"HIV-protective behaviours (including condom use, HIV testing, fewer concurrent partners)\", \"significantly increased\", \"Men in intervention communities were significantly more likely than controls to report a broad range of HIV-protective behaviours, including higher levels of condom use (aRR 2.03, 95% CI 1.22–3.39), HIV testing (aRR 1.50, 95% CI 1.13–2.00) and fewer concurrent partners (aRR 0.60, 95% CI 0.37–0.97).\"],\n    [\"SASA! intervention\", \"control communities\", \"joint decision-making\", \"significantly increased\", \"They were also more likely to report increased joint decision-making (aRR 1.92, 95% CI 1.27–2.91)\"],\n    [\"SASA! intervention\", \"control communities\", \"male participation in household tasks\", \"significantly increased\", \"greater male participation in household tasks (aRR 1.48, 95% CI 1.09–2.01)\"],\n    [\"SASA! intervention\", \"control communities\", \"open communication\", \"significantly increased\", \"more open communication and greater appreciation of their partner's work inside (aRR 1.31, 95% CI 1.04–1.66) and outside (aRR 1.49, 95% CI 1.08–2.06) the home\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"SASA! intervention\", \"control communities\", \"HIV-protective behaviours (including condom use, HIV testing, fewer concurrent partners)\", \"significantly increased\", \"Men in intervention communities were significantly more likely than controls to report a broad range of HIV-protective behaviours, including higher levels of condom use (aRR 2.03, 95% CI 1.22–3.39), HIV testing (aRR 1.50, 95% CI 1.13–2.00) and fewer concurrent partners (aRR 0.60, 95% CI 0.37–0.97).\"],\n    [\"SASA! intervention\", \"control communities\", \"joint decision-making\", \"significantly increased\", \"They were also more likely to report increased joint decision-making (aRR 1.92, 95% CI 1.27–2.91)\"],\n    [\"SASA! intervention\", \"control communities\", \"male participation in household tasks\", \"significantly increased\", \"greater male participation in household tasks (aRR 1.48, 95% CI 1.09–2.01)\"],\n    [\"SASA! intervention\", \"control communities\", \"open communication\", \"significantly increased\", \"more open communication and greater appreciation of their partner's work inside (aRR 1.31, 95% CI 1.04–1.66) and outside (aRR 1.49, 95% CI 1.08–2.06) the home\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "e9c638975411f0f42943253cf3434c5648155bea11afb74b9b82d3da3a4100de", "prompt_hash": "ebaa2970f71066586399dc30e252f4921fe8e66debfecda33bb7886e02f6863a", "target_hash": "9672de3bd461d968a105d10e0467376113dd94c291ae2c1548e965e799c5445d", "bypass": null}

The objectives of this study were to determine whether vitamin D supplementation to patients with tuberculosis (TB) could influence recovery.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Two hundred and fifty nine patients with pulmonary TB were randomized to receive either 600,000 IU of Intramuscular vitamin D3 or placebo for 2 doses. Assessments were performed at 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Early secreted and T cell activated 6 kDa (ESAT6) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis sonicate (MTBs) antigen induced whole blood stimulated IFN-g responses were measured at 0 and 12 weeks. Statistical comparisons between outcome variables at 0 and 12 weeks were performed using Student's t-test and Chi2 tests.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: After 12 weeks, the vitamin D supplemented arm demonstrated significantly greater mean weight gain (kg) + 3.75, (3.16 – 4.34) versus + 2.61 (95% CI 1.99 – 3.23) p 0.009 and lesser residual disease by chest radiograph; number of zones involved 1.35 v/s 1.82 p 0.004 (95% CI 0.15, 0.79) and 50% or greater reduction in cavity size 106 (89.8%) v/s 111 (94.8%), p 0.035.

Outcome was based on the effects of insulin therapy on biochemical and hormonal changes during treatment and recovery of DKA. <p> RESULTS—The load group reached a peak in free insulin value (460 μU/ml) within 5 min and plateaued at 88 μU/ml in 60 min. The twice no load group reached a peak (200 μU/ml) at 45 min. The no load group reached a peak (60 μU/ml) in 60–120 min. Five patients in the no load group required supplemental insulin doses to decrease initial glucose levels by 10%; patients in the twice no load and load groups did not. Except for these differences, times to reach glucose ≤250 mg/dl, pH ≥7.3, and HCO3− ≥15 mEq/l did not differ significantly among the three groups. <p> CONCLUSIONS—A priming dose in low-dose insulin therapy in patients with DKA is unnecessary if an adequate dose of regular insulin of 0.14 unit · kg body weight−1 · h−1 (about 10 units/h in a 70-kg patient) is given.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Insulin 0.07 IU/kg infusion\", \"Insulin 0.07 IU/kg load + 0.07 IU/kg infusion\", \"Time for reaching glucose predetermined values \", \"no significant difference\", \", times to reach glucose \\u2264250 mg/dl, pH \\u22657.3, and HCO3\\u2212 \\u226515 mEq/l did not differ significantly among the three groups.\"], [\"Insulin 0.07 IU/kg infusion\", \"Insulin 0.07 IU/kg load + 0.07 IU/kg infusion\", \"Time for reaching bicarbonate predetermined values \", \"no significant difference\", \", times to reach glucose \\u2264250 mg/dl, pH \\u22657.3, and HCO3\\u2212 \\u226515 mEq/l did not differ significantly among the three groups.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Fresh Scoparia dulcis porridge elicited a low glycaemic index (GI) and anti-hyperglycaemic effects when fed to diabetic Wistar rats. Commercially produced Scoparia dulcis porridge (SDC) elicited medium GI. Present study was aimed at studying the anti-diabetic effects of consumption of commercially produced S. dulcis porridge.\n\nABSTRACT.METHOD: A randomized crossover clinical trial with type 2 diabetic patients (n = 35) on medication, with mild and moderate diabetes [fasting blood glucose (FBG) 126–300 mg/dL, age 35–70 years] was conducted. Within the first three months (study period 1) group 1 was the test and group 2 was the control. Following a wash-out period, the two groups were crossed over (study period 2: group 1 – control; group 2 - test). Test group consumed commercially produced SDC for 3 days/week for three months and the control group any other food. At the onset and end of each study period glucose measurements [Fasting Blood Glucose (FBG), HbA1c], lipid measurements (total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides, cholesterol ratios), toxicity parameters (liver enzymes, creatinine, CRP, eGFR) were analyzed by enzyme assay kit methods using a KONELAB 20XT auto analyzer. Significances between groups were analyzed by one way ANOVA (normal distribution) and Mann Whitney test (if the values were not normally distributed). Within group comparisons were carried out by Bonferroni post hoc test.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: During the crossover clinical trial HbA1c of group 1 decreased from 7.9 ± 0.5 to 6.5 ± 0.3 (p = 0.003) while HbA1c of group 2 decreased from 7.0 ± 0.3to 6.7 ± 0.3 while in the test group. Therefore, both test groups (1 and 2) elicited a decrease in HbA1c compared to respective control groups. Both test groups elicited a non significant decrease in FBG following the intervention (group 1 - from 174 ± 14 to 160 ± 10 mg/dL; group 2 - from 183 ± 13 to 160 ± 7 mg/dL). No significant differences (p >0.05) in insulin, cholesterol measurements (total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides and cholesterol ratios) and atherogenic index between or within groups were observed. All other measurements (AST, ALT, ALP, creatinine, CRP, eGFR) were normal and not significantly different between or within groups.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Porridge made with SDC leaf extract decreased FBG and HbA1c (p >0.05) of type 2 diabetic patients. The porridge had no effect on cholesterol measurements and no toxicity was observed at the dose tested.

Very few studies have compared the effect of bispectral index (BIS) monitoring versus standard end-tidal anesthetic gas (ETAG) concentration monitoring on tracheal extubation time for halothane-based anesthesia. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of BIS versus ETAG-guided anesthesia on time to tracheal extubation for halothane-based anesthesia in general surgical setting.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS:: This was a randomized, controlled double-blind study. Sixty patients with the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status Class 1 or 2, receiving halothane-based general anesthesia were randomized to BIS-guided (n = 30) and ETAG-guided anesthesia (n = 30). Time to tracheal extubation was measured. In BIS group, BIS value was kept between 40 and 60 while in ETAG group; ETAG value was kept between 0.7 and 1.3 minimum alveolar concentration. The two groups were compared using Student's t-test, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data were processed and analyzed using SPSS version 17 software.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: Mean time to tracheal extubation was significantly longer in BIS group (9.63 ± 3.02 min) as compared to ETAG group (5.29 ± 1.51 min), mean difference 4.34 min with 95% confidence interval (3.106, 5.982) (P < 0.05).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: In our study, the extubation time was significantly longer in BIS-guided anesthesia as compared to ETAG-guided anesthesia. ETAG monitoring promotes earlier extubation of patients as compared to BIS monitoring during halothane anesthesia.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Bispectral index (BIS) guided anesthesia\", \"Standard end-tidal anesthetic gas (ETAG) guided anesthesia\", \"Time to tracheal extubation\", \"significantly increased\", \"Mean time to tracheal extubation was significantly longer in BIS group (9.63 \\u00b1 3.02 min) as compared to ETAG group (5.29 \\u00b1 1.51 min), mean difference 4.34 min with 95% confidence interval (3.106, 5.982) (P \\u003c 0.05).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Fresh Scoparia dulcis porridge elicited a low glycaemic index (GI) and anti-hyperglycaemic effects when fed to diabetic Wistar rats. Commercially produced Scoparia dulcis porridge (SDC) elicited medium GI. Present study was aimed at studying the anti-diabetic effects of consumption of commercially produced S. dulcis porridge.\n\nABSTRACT.METHOD: A randomized crossover clinical trial with type 2 diabetic patients (n = 35) on medication, with mild and moderate diabetes [fasting blood glucose (FBG) 126–300 mg/dL, age 35–70 years] was conducted. Within the first three months (study period 1) group 1 was the test and group 2 was the control. Following a wash-out period, the two groups were crossed over (study period 2: group 1 – control; group 2 - test). Test group consumed commercially produced SDC for 3 days/week for three months and the control group any other food. At the onset and end of each study period glucose measurements [Fasting Blood Glucose (FBG), HbA1c], lipid measurements (total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides, cholesterol ratios), toxicity parameters (liver enzymes, creatinine, CRP, eGFR) were analyzed by enzyme assay kit methods using a KONELAB 20XT auto analyzer. Significances between groups were analyzed by one way ANOVA (normal distribution) and Mann Whitney test (if the values were not normally distributed). Within group comparisons were carried out by Bonferroni post hoc test.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: During the crossover clinical trial HbA1c of group 1 decreased from 7.9 ± 0.5 to 6.5 ± 0.3 (p = 0.003) while HbA1c of group 2 decreased from 7.0 ± 0.3to 6.7 ± 0.3 while in the test group. Therefore, both test groups (1 and 2) elicited a decrease in HbA1c compared to respective control groups. Both test groups elicited a non significant decrease in FBG following the intervention (group 1 - from 174 ± 14 to 160 ± 10 mg/dL; group 2 - from 183 ± 13 to 160 ± 7 mg/dL). No significant differences (p >0.05) in insulin, cholesterol measurements (total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides and cholesterol ratios) and atherogenic index between or within groups were observed. All other measurements (AST, ALT, ALP, creatinine, CRP, eGFR) were normal and not significantly different between or within groups.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Porridge made with SDC leaf extract decreased FBG and HbA1c (p >0.05) of type 2 diabetic patients.

We evaluated the efficacy of a multistrain probiotic compound, alone and in combination with lactulose, in the treatment of MHE.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:: This study has two parts. First, consecutive adult patients with MHE were randomized to receive lactulose (30–60 mL/day) + probiotic (200 million colony forming units of seven bacteria species/day) (Gp-LPr) or lactulose + placebo (Gp-L). In second part, a non-randomized group of patients received probiotic alone (Gp-Pr). Medication duration was for 2 weeks and patients were followed-up for another 8 weeks. Improvement in MHE status was assessed by psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES). Development of overt encephalopathy, hospitalization, and death were considered as secondary outcomes.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: Sixty patients (80% male, mean age 38.4 ± 9.6 years) completed the intervention.

Here, a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study examined the effect of olanzapine (an atypical antipsychotic) augmentation therapy on sleep architecture, specifically slow wave sleep (SWS), in the treatment of depression. The effect of olanzapine augmentation therapy on other features of sleep (e.g., sleep continuity) and depression (e.g., illness severity and cognitive function) were also determined.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Patients currently experiencing a major depressive episode and who were on a stable medication were included. Sleep architecture was measured by overnight ambulatory polysomnography. Illness severity was determined using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Cognitive function was examined using Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB): Spatial Working Memory (SWM), Spatial Span (SSP), and Reaction Time (RTI) tasks. Polysomnographs, clinical measures and cognitive tests were administered at baseline, after 2–4 days of treatment and after 28–31 days of treatment. Twenty-five patients participated in the study (N = 10, N = 15 for placebo and olanzapine treated groups respectively).\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The primary objective of the study was to assess the objective (polysomnographic) changes in sleep quality, defined as changes in SWS, following olanzapine treatment for depression. Latency to but not duration of SWS was found to significantly differ between olanzapine- and placebo-treated participants (Hedge's g: 0.97, 0.13 respectively). A significant improvement in olanzapine-treated participants over placebo-treated participants was observed in secondary outcome measures, including sleep efficiency, total sleep time, and sleep latency. Secondary objectives assessed the subjective changes in sleep quality parameters and correlated them with measures of illness severity and changes in cognition. MADRS scores were significantly improved in olanzapine-treated participants over time but not more than placebo treatment. There was no significant difference between olanzapine- and placebo-treated participants in SWM, SSP or RTI tasks.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine augmentation treatment generally did not improve SWS but did improve sleep continuity and depression. Olanzapine may be one of few medications that improve sleep continuity, thus directly targeting symptoms of depression.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov,\nNCT00520507.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"olanzapine\", \"placebo\", \"sleep efficiency \", \"significantly increased\", \"A significant improvement in olanzapine-treated participants over placebo-treated participants was observed in secondary outcome measures, including sleep efficiency, total sleep time, and sleep latency.\"], [\"olanzapine\", \"placebo\", \"Spatial Working Memory (SWM), Spatial Span (SSP), and Reaction Time (RTI) tasks\", \"no significant difference\", \"There was no significant difference between olanzapine- and placebo-treated participants in SWM, SSP or RTI tasks.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

In total, 106 subjects were randomly assigned to the telemonitoring (n = 53) or usual care (n = 53) group. During the two months following discharge, telemonitoring group patients had to report their symptoms daily using an electronic diary. The primary outcome measure was time to first re-admission for COPD exacerbation within six months of discharge. During the follow-up period, time to first re-admission for COPD exacerbation was significantly increased in the telemonitoring group than in the usual care group (p = 0.026).

Haemodynamic parameters were assessed at baseline and week 16.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Riociguat decreased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in inoperable (n=189; least-squares mean difference: −285 dyn s/cm5 (95% CI −357 to −213); p<0.0001) and persistent/recurrent (n=72; −131 dyn s/cm5 (95% CI −214 to −48); p=0.0025) patients. Cardiac index improved in inoperable patients by a least-squares mean difference of +0.6 L/min/m2 (95% CI 0.4 to 0.7; p<0.0001), while in persistent/recurrent patients the change was +0.2 L/min/m2 (95% CI −0.1 to 0.5; p=0.17). Mean pulmonary artery pressure decreased in inoperable and persistent/recurrent patients(−4.7 mm Hg (95% CI −6.9 to −2.6; p<0.0001 and −4.8 mm Hg (–8.2 to −1.5; p=0.0055), respectively). For all patients, changes in 6 min walk distance correlated with changes in PVR (r=−0.29 (95% CI −0.41 to −0.17); p<0.0001) and cardiac index (r=0.23 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.35); p=0.0004).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Riociguat improved haemodynamics in patients with inoperable CTEPH or persistent/recurrent CTEPH.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00855465.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Riociguat group\", \"Placebo group\", \"Improvement of cardiac index in persistent/recurrent patients\", \"no significant difference\", \"Cardiac index improved in inoperable patients by a least-squares mean difference of +0.6 L/min/m2 (95% CI 0.4 to 0.7; p\\u003c0.0001), while in persistent/recurrent patients the change was +0.2 L/min/m2 (95% CI \\u22120.1 to 0.5; p=0.17).\"], [\"Riociguat group\", \"Placebo group\", \"Pulmonary vascular resistance\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Riociguat decreased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in inoperable (n=189; least-squares mean difference: \\u2212285 dyn s/cm5 (95% CI \\u2212357 to \\u2212213); p\\u003c0.0001) and persistent/recurrent (n=72; \\u2212131 dyn s/cm5 (95% CI \\u2212214 to \\u221248); p=0.0025) patients.\"], [\"Riociguat group\", \"Placebo group\", \"Mean pulmonary artery pressure\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Mean pulmonary artery pressure decreased in inoperable and persistent/recurrent patients(\\u22124.7 mm Hg (95% CI \\u22126.9 to \\u22122.6; p\\u003c0.0001 and \\u22124.8 mm Hg (\\u20138.2 to \\u22121.5; p=0.0055), respectively)\"], [\"Riociguat group\", \"Placebo group\", \"Improvement of cardiac index in inoperable patients\", \"significantly increased\", \"Cardiac index improved in inoperable patients by a least-squares mean difference of +0.6 L/min/m2 (95% CI 0.4 to 0.7; p\\u003c0.0001), while in persistent/recurrent patients the change was +0.2 L/min/m2 (95% CI \\u22120.1 to 0.5; p=0.17).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

The intervention group attended individual sessions with an experienced clinician once a week for 10 weeks and performed daily home exercises with adherence monitored by a self-report diary. The control group received no treatment. Blinded assessment was conducted at baseline and 11 weeks. Questionnaires assessed self-reported changes in back pain, physical function, and health-related quality of life. Objective measures of thoracic kyphosis, back and shoulder muscle endurance (Timed Loaded Standing Test), and function (Timed Up and Go test) were also taken.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the intervention group showed significant reductions in pain during movement (mean difference (95% CI) -1.8 (-3.5 to -0.1)) and at rest (-2.0 (-3.8 to -0.2)) and significantly greater improvements in Qualeffo physical function (-4.8 (-9.2 to -0.5)) and the Timed Loaded Standing test (46.7 (16.1 to 77.3) secs).

As monotherapy in patients with CLL, it has no clinical activity. Here we report the results of an open-label, randomized phase II trial comparing the combination of pentostatin, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (PCR) either without or with bevacizumab (PCR-B) in previously untreated CLL patients. A total of 65 evaluable patients were enrolled, 32 receiving PCR and 33 PCR-B. A higher rate of grade 3-4 cardiovascular toxicity was observed with PCR-B (33% vs. 3%, p < 0.003). Patients treated with PCR-B had a trend for a higher complete remission (CR) rate (54.5% vs 31.3%; p = 0.08), longer progression-free survival (PFS)(p = 0.06) and treatment-free survival (TFS)(p = 0.09).

The intervention group attended individual sessions with an experienced clinician once a week for 10 weeks and performed daily home exercises with adherence monitored by a self-report diary. The control group received no treatment. Blinded assessment was conducted at baseline and 11 weeks. Questionnaires assessed self-reported changes in back pain, physical function, and health-related quality of life. Objective measures of thoracic kyphosis, back and shoulder muscle endurance (Timed Loaded Standing Test), and function (Timed Up and Go test) were also taken.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the intervention group showed significant reductions in pain during movement (mean difference (95% CI) -1.8 (-3.5 to -0.1)) and at rest (-2.0 (-3.8 to -0.2)) and significantly greater improvements in Qualeffo physical function (-4.8 (-9.2 to -0.5)) and the Timed Loaded Standing test (46.7 (16.1 to 77.3) secs). For the perceived change in back pain over the 10 weeks, 9/11 (82%) participants in the intervention group rated their pain as 'much better' compared with only 1/9 (11%) participants in the control group.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Despite the modest sample size, these results support the benefits of exercise and manual therapy in the clinical management of patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures, but need to be confirmed in a larger sample.\n\nABSTRACT.TRAIL REGISTRATION: NCT00638768\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"physiotherapy program, including exercise and manual therapy\", \"no treatment\", \"back pain during movement\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Compared with the control group, the intervention group showed significant reductions in pain during movement (mean difference (95% CI) -1.8 (-3.5 to -0.1))\"],\n    [\"physiotherapy program, including exercise and manual therapy\", \"no treatment\", \"back pain at rest\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Compared with the control group, the intervention group showed significant reductions in pain during movement (mean difference (95% CI) -1.8 (-3.5 to -0.1)) and at rest (-2.0 (-3.8 to -0.2))\"],\n    [\"physiotherapy program, including exercise and manual therapy\", \"no treatment\", \"Qualeffo physical function\", \"significantly increased\", \"Compared with the control group, the intervention group showed significant reductions in pain during movement (mean difference (95% CI) -1.8 (-3.5 to -0.1)) and at rest (-2.0 (-3.8 to -0.2)) and significantly greater improvements in Qualeffo physical function (-4.8 (-9.2 to -0.5))\"],\n    [\"physiotherapy program, including exercise and manual therapy\", \"no treatment\", \"Timed Loaded Standing test\", \"significantly increased\", \"Compared with the control group, the intervention group showed significant reductions in pain during movement (mean difference (95% CI) -1.8 (-3.5 to -0.1)) and at rest (-2.0 (-3.8 to -0.2)) and significantly greater improvements in Qualeffo physical function (-4.8 (-9.2 to -0.5)) and the Timed Loaded Standing test (46.7 (16.1 to 77.3) secs)\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"physiotherapy program, including exercise and manual therapy\", \"no treatment\", \"back pain during movement\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Compared with the control group, the intervention group showed significant reductions in pain during movement (mean difference (95% CI) -1.8 (-3.5 to -0.1))\"],\n    [\"physiotherapy program, including exercise and manual therapy\", \"no treatment\", \"back pain at rest\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Compared with the control group, the intervention group showed significant reductions in pain during movement (mean difference (95% CI) -1.8 (-3.5 to -0.1)) and at rest (-2.0 (-3.8 to -0.2))\"],\n    [\"physiotherapy program, including exercise and manual therapy\", \"no treatment\", \"Qualeffo physical function\", \"significantly increased\", \"Compared with the control group, the intervention group showed significant reductions in pain during movement (mean difference (95% CI) -1.8 (-3.5 to -0.1)) and at rest (-2.0 (-3.8 to -0.2)) and significantly greater improvements in Qualeffo physical function (-4.8 (-9.2 to -0.5))\"],\n    [\"physiotherapy program, including exercise and manual therapy\", \"no treatment\", \"Timed Loaded Standing test\", \"significantly increased\", \"Compared with the control group, the intervention group showed significant reductions in pain during movement (mean difference (95% CI) -1.8 (-3.5 to -0.1)) and at rest (-2.0 (-3.8 to -0.2)) and significantly greater improvements in Qualeffo physical function (-4.8 (-9.2 to -0.5)) and the Timed Loaded Standing test (46.7 (16.1 to 77.3) secs)\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "aaafc8f2b6697a8f00408ff8fdc9b1379b8091c665486e82e1948f3450bca007", "prompt_hash": "86fcc900ea24f15f0396a8f071f7a6b61436c90c92f239f5405119aac63135b6", "target_hash": "e4f33cfcbd40f5cd68f195c7330f303a0b7a87c3831bd2d80659c8371074b11c", "bypass": null}

This suggests a gap in knowledge for persons with OA regarding the many different treatments available to them.\n\nABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate outcomes after usage of a Web-based resource called My Joint Pain that contains tailored, evidence-based information and tools aimed to improve self-management of OA on self-management and change in knowledge.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: A quasi-experimental design was used to evaluate the My Joint Pain website intervention over a 12-month period. The intervention provided participants with general and user-specific information, monthly assessments with validated instruments, and progress-tracking tools. A nationwide convenience sample of 195 participants with self-assessed hip and/or knee OA completed both baseline and 12-month questionnaires (users: n=104; nonusers: n=91). The primary outcome measure was the Health Evaluation Impact Questionnaire (heiQ) to evaluate 8 different domains (health-directed activity, positive and active engagement in life, emotional distress, self-monitoring and insight, constructive attitudes and approaches, skill and technique acquisition, social integration and support, health service navigation) and the secondary outcome measure was the 17-item Osteoarthritis Quality Indicator (OAQI) questionnaire to evaluate the change in appropriateness of care received by participants. Independent t tests were used to compare changes between groups for the heiQ and chi-square tests to identify changes within and between groups from baseline to 12 months for each OAQI item.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Baseline demographics between groups were similar for gender (152/195, 77.9% female), age (mean 60, SD 9 years) and body mass index (mean 31.1, SD 6.8 kg/m2). With the exception of health service navigation, mean effect sizes from all other heiQ domains showed a positive trend for My Joint Pain users compared to the nonusers, although the differences between groups did not reach statistical significance. Within-group changes also showed improvements among the users of the My Joint Pain website for self-management (absolute change score=15%, P=.03), lifestyle (absolute change score=16%, P=.02), and physical activity (absolute change score=11%, P=.04), with no significant improvements for the nonusers. Following 12 months of exposure to the website, there were significant improvements for users compared to nonusers in self-management (absolute change score 15% vs 2%, P=.001) and weight reduction (absolute change scores 3% vs –6%, P=.03) measured on the OAQI.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: The My Joint Pain Web resource does not significantly improve overall heiQ, but does improve other important aspects of quality of care in people with hip and/or knee OA.

The present intervention study evaluated the effect in subjects over 60-yr-old. The vitamin K group (vitamin K + vitamin D + calcium supplement; 15 mg of vitamin K2 [menatetrenone] three times daily, 400 IU of vitamin D once a day, and 315 mg of calcium twice daily) and the control group (vitamin D + calcium supplement) were randomly assigned. During the six months of treatment, seventy eight women participated (38 in the vitamin K group and 40 in the control group) and 45 women completed the study. The baseline characteristics of study participants did not differ between the vitamin K and the control groups. In a per protocol analysis after 6 months, L3 bone mineral density has increased statistically significantly in the vitamin K group compared to the control group (0.01 ± 0.03 g/cm2 vs -0.008 ± 0.04 g/cm2, P = 0.049). UcOC concentration was also significantly decreased in the vitamin K group (-1.6 ± 1.6 ng/dL vs -0.4 ± 1.1 ng/dL, P = 0.008). In conclusion, addition of vitamin K to vitamin D and calcium supplements in the postmenopausal Korean women increase the L3 BMD and reduce the UcOC concentration.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Vitamin K + supplementation\", \"Supplementation alone\", \"Mineral density\", \"significantly increased\", \"L3 bone mineral density has increased statistically significantly in the vitamin K group compared to the control group (0.01 \\u00b1 0.03 g/cm2 vs -0.008 \\u00b1 0.04 g/cm2, P = 0.049).\"], [\"Vitamin K + supplementation\", \"Supplementation alone\", \"Undercarboxylated osteocalcin\", \"significantly decreased\", \"L3 bone mineral density has increased statistically significantly in the vitamin K group compared to the control group (0.01 \\u00b1 0.03 g/cm2 vs -0.008 \\u00b1 0.04 g/cm2, P = 0.049).

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of rosuvastatin, alone or associated with zinc and selenium supplementation, on lipid profile, antioxidant enzymes and mineral status in coronary artery disease patients.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A double-blind randomized clinical trial was performed in which patients (n = 76) were treated with 10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months associated or not with zinc (30 mg/d) and selenium (150 μg/d) supplementation. The following parameters were analyzed before and after the intervention: anthropometric measurements, lipid profile, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), electronegative low density lipoprotein (LDL(-)) concentrations, activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), zinc and selenium concentrations in blood plasma and erythocytes. Significance was determined using an α of 5% (two-tailed).\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: We found that rosuvastatin therapy was efficient in reducing total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and hs-CRP independently of mineral supplementation. Neither treatment was associated with significant changes in LDL(-). Similarly, the antioxidant enzymes GPx and SOD activity were unchanged by treatments. Neither treatment was associated with significant differences in concentrations of zinc or selenium in blood plasma and erythocytes of studied groups.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Rosuvastatin treatment did not affect zinc and selenium levels in coronary artery disease patients. The zinc and selenium supplementation at doses used in this study did not change lipid profile or SOD and GPx activity in patients receiving rosuvastatin. Further studies should be focused on testing alternative doses and supplements in different populations to contribute for a consensus on the ideal choice of antioxidants to be used as possible complementary therapies in atherosclerotic patients.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01547377\n\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months with zinc (30 mg/d) and selenium (150 I\\u03021\\u20444g/d) supplementation.\", \"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months\", \"glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels\", \"no significant difference\", \"Similarly, the activities of the antioxidant enzymes GPx and SOD were unchanged by treatments (P \\u003e 0.42) and were similar in both groups (P \\u003e 0.33).\"], [\"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months with zinc (30 mg/d) and selenium (150 I\\u03021\\u20444g/d) supplementation.\", \"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months\", \"glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels\", \"no significant difference\", \"Similarly, the antioxidant enzymes GPx and SOD activity were unchanged by treatments.\"], [\"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months with zinc (30 mg/d) and selenium (150 I\\u03021\\u20444g/d) supplementation.\", \"10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months\", \"total cholesterol, LDL-c, and non-HDL-c levels\", \"no significant difference\", \"Significant decreases in total cholesterol, LDL-c, and non-HDL-c levels were observed for all patients, regardless of group;

This study aims to assess changes in attitudes toward patient safety culture and frequency of quality-related event (QRE) reporting after guided implementation of a continuous quality improvement (CQI) program in a panel of community pharmacies in the United States (U.S.).\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Twenty-one community pharmacies volunteered to participate in the project and were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. Pharmacy staff in the intervention group received guided training to ensure full implementation of a CQI program while those in the control group partially implemented the program. Pharmacy staff in both groups completed retrospective pre-post safety culture questionnaires and reported medication errors and near misses that occurred in their practices. Rasch analysis was applied to assess questionnaire validity and reliability and to confirm if the ordinal level data approximated interval level measures. Paired t-tests and repeated measure analysis of covariance tests were subsequently used to compare observed changes in the attitudes of subjects and frequency of QREs reporting in intervention and control groups.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Sixty-nine employees completed the questionnaire, a 43.9% response rate. Improvement in attitudes toward patient safety was statistically significant in the intervention group in six domains: staff, training, and skill (p = 0.017); patient counseling (p = 0.043); communication about mistakes (p < 0.001); response to mistakes (p < 0.001); organizational learning – continuous improvement (p < 0.001); and overall patient safety perceptions (p = 0.033). No significant differences were observed in QRE reporting rates between intervention and control groups. However, differences were observed in the types of QREs reported (e.g., incorrect safety cap) and the point in the prescription processing workflow where a QRE was detected (e.g., partner check station, and drug utilization review station) in the intervention group (p < 0.001).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Guided CQI program implementation increased the self-reported patient safety culture attitudes among staff.\n\nABSTRACT.ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (10.1186/s40545-017-0114-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Continuous quality improvement program\", \"Control\", \"Communication about mistakes\", \"significantly increased\", \"Improvement in attitudes toward patient safety was statistically significant in the intervention group in six domains: staff, training, and skill (p = 0.017); patient counseling (p = 0.043); communication about mistakes (p \\u003c 0.001); response to mistakes (p \\u003c 0.001); organizational learning \\u2013 continuous improvement (p \\u003c 0.001); and overall patient safety perceptions (p = 0.033).\"], [\"Continuous quality improvement program\", \"Control\", \"Patient counseling\", \"significantly increased\", \".

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of rosuvastatin, alone or associated with zinc and selenium supplementation, on lipid profile, antioxidant enzymes and mineral status in coronary artery disease patients.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A double-blind randomized clinical trial was performed in which patients (n = 76) were treated with 10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months associated or not with zinc (30 mg/d) and selenium (150 μg/d) supplementation. The following parameters were analyzed before and after the intervention: anthropometric measurements, lipid profile, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), electronegative low density lipoprotein (LDL(-)) concentrations, activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), zinc and selenium concentrations in blood plasma and erythocytes. Significance was determined using an α of 5% (two-tailed).\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: We found that rosuvastatin therapy was efficient in reducing total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and hs-CRP independently of mineral supplementation. Neither treatment was associated with significant changes in LDL(-). Similarly, the antioxidant enzymes GPx and SOD activity were unchanged by treatments. Neither treatment was associated with significant differences in concentrations of zinc or selenium in blood plasma and erythocytes of studied groups.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Rosuvastatin treatment did not affect zinc and selenium levels in coronary artery disease patients. The zinc and selenium supplementation at doses used in this study did not change lipid profile or SOD and GPx activity in patients receiving rosuvastatin. Further studies should be focused on testing alternative doses and supplements in different populations to contribute for a consensus on the ideal choice of antioxidants to be used as possible complementary therapies in atherosclerotic patients.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01547377\n\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"rosuvastatin\", \"zinc and selenium supplementation\", \"total cholesterol\", \"significantly decreased\", \"We found that rosuvastatin therapy was efficient in reducing total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and hs-CRP independently of mineral supplementation.\"],\n    [\"rosuvastatin\", \"zinc and selenium supplementation\", \"LDL-cholesterol\", \"significantly decreased\", \"We found that rosuvastatin therapy was efficient in reducing total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and hs-CRP independently of mineral supplementation.\"],\n    [\"rosuvastatin\", \"zinc and selenium supplementation\", \"non-HDL cholesterol\", \"significantly decreased\", \"We found that rosuvastatin therapy was efficient in reducing total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and hs-CRP independently of mineral supplementation.\"],\n    [\"rosuvastatin\", \"zinc and selenium supplementation\", \"triglycerides\", \"significantly decreased\", \"We found that rosuvastatin therapy was efficient in reducing total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and hs-CRP independently of mineral supplementation.\"],\n    [\"rosuvastatin\", \"zinc and selenium supplementation\", \"high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)\", \"significantly decreased\", \"We found that rosuvastatin therapy was efficient in reducing total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and hs-CRP independently of mineral supplementation.\"],\n    [\"zinc and selenium supplementation\", \"rosuvastatin\", \"zinc and selenium concentrations in blood plasma and erythocytes\", \"no significant difference\", \"Neither treatment was associated with significant differences in concentrations of zinc or selenium in blood plasma and erythocytes of studied groups.\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"rosuvastatin\", \"zinc and selenium supplementation\", \"total cholesterol\", \"significantly decreased\", \"We found that rosuvastatin therapy was efficient in reducing total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and hs-CRP independently of mineral supplementation.\"],\n    [\"rosuvastatin\", \"zinc and selenium supplementation\", \"LDL-cholesterol\", \"significantly decreased\", \"We found that rosuvastatin therapy was efficient in reducing total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and hs-CRP independently of mineral supplementation.\"],\n    [\"rosuvastatin\", \"zinc and selenium supplementation\", \"non-HDL cholesterol\", \"significantly decreased\", \"We found that rosuvastatin therapy was efficient in reducing total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and hs-CRP independently of mineral supplementation.\"],\n    [\"rosuvastatin\", \"zinc and selenium supplementation\", \"triglycerides\", \"significantly decreased\", \"We found that rosuvastatin therapy was efficient in reducing total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and hs-CRP independently of mineral supplementation.\"],\n    [\"rosuvastatin\", \"zinc and selenium supplementation\", \"high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)\", \"significantly decreased\", \"We found that rosuvastatin therapy was efficient in reducing total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and hs-CRP independently of mineral supplementation.\"],\n    [\"zinc and selenium supplementation\", \"rosuvastatin\", \"zinc and selenium concentrations in blood plasma and erythocytes\", \"no significant difference\", \"Neither treatment was associated with significant differences in concentrations of zinc or selenium in blood plasma and erythocytes of studied groups.\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "c83829766ebe82e50299e19e21946861dabd1eeabae7b72c2650a1f5a8431e75", "prompt_hash": "1795db006464cfd913aa615571dfea5801ab37d259cbba90a7f5147ba575c941", "target_hash": "66efc40f5dceb7bab95755264e461a74208fbe0e6d24d7f7d51fa10ab14ef13c", "bypass": null}

This study aimed to design and implement an empowerment educational intervention to prevent elder abuse.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: This parallel randomized controlled trial was conducted in 2014–2016 for 18 months on 464 older adults aged above 60 years who visited health houses of 22 municipalities in Tehran. Data were collected using standard questionnaires, including the Elder Abuse-Knowledge Questionnaire, Health-Promoting Behavior Questionnaire, Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II, Barriers to Healthy Lifestyle, Perceived Social Support, Perceived Self-Efficacy, Loneliness Scale, Geriatric Depression Scale, Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale, and the SCARED (stress, coping, argument, resources, events, and dependence) tool. The intervention was done in twenty 45- to 60-minute training sessions over 6 months. Data analysis were performed using χ2 tests, multiple linear and logistic regression, and structural equation modeling (SEM).\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The frequency of knowledge of elder abuse, self-efficacy, social support and health promoting lifestyle before the intervention was similar in the two groups. However, the frequency of high knowledge of elder abuse (94.8% in the intervention group and 46.6% in the control group), high self-efficacy (82.8% and 7.8%, respectively), high social support (97.0% and 10.3%, respectively) and high health promoting lifestyle (97.0% and 10.3%, respectively) was significantly higher (P<0.001) and the frequency of elder abuse risk (28.0% and 49.6%, respectively) was significantly less in the intervention group after the intervention. SEM standardized beta (Sβ) showed that the intervention had the highest impact on increase social support (Sβ=0.80, β=48.64, SE=1.70, P<0.05), self-efficacy (Sβ=0.76, β=13.32, SE=0.52, P<0.05) and health promoting behaviors (Sβ=0.48, β=33.08, SE=2.26, P<0.05), respectively.

Haemodynamic parameters were assessed at baseline and week 16.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Riociguat decreased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in inoperable (n=189; least-squares mean difference: −285 dyn s/cm5 (95% CI −357 to −213); p<0.0001) and persistent/recurrent (n=72; −131 dyn s/cm5 (95% CI −214 to −48); p=0.0025) patients. Cardiac index improved in inoperable patients by a least-squares mean difference of +0.6 L/min/m2 (95% CI 0.4 to 0.7; p<0.0001), while in persistent/recurrent patients the change was +0.2 L/min/m2 (95% CI −0.1 to 0.5; p=0.17). Mean pulmonary artery pressure decreased in inoperable and persistent/recurrent patients(−4.7 mm Hg (95% CI −6.9 to −2.6; p<0.0001 and −4.8 mm Hg (–8.2 to −1.5; p=0.0055), respectively). For all patients, changes in 6 min walk distance correlated with changes in PVR (r=−0.29 (95% CI −0.41 to −0.17); p<0.0001) and cardiac index (r=0.23 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.35); p=0.0004).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Riociguat improved haemodynamics in patients with inoperable CTEPH or persistent/recurrent CTEPH.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00855465.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"Riociguat group\", \"Placebo group\", \"Improvement of cardiac index in persistent/recurrent patients\", \"no significant difference\", \"Cardiac index improved in inoperable patients by a least-squares mean difference of +0.6 L/min/m2 (95% CI 0.4 to 0.7; p\\u003c0.0001), while in persistent/recurrent patients the change was +0.2 L/min/m2 (95% CI \\u22120.1 to 0.5; p=0.17).\"], [\"Riociguat group\", \"Placebo group\", \"Pulmonary vascular resistance\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Riociguat decreased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in inoperable (n=189; least-squares mean difference: \\u2212285 dyn s/cm5 (95% CI \\u2212357 to \\u2212213); p\\u003c0.0001) and persistent/recurrent (n=72; \\u2212131 dyn s/cm5 (95% CI \\u2212214 to \\u221248); p=0.0025) patients.\"], [\"Riociguat group\", \"Placebo group\", \"Mean pulmonary artery pressure\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Mean pulmonary artery pressure decreased in inoperable and persistent/recurrent patients(\\u22124.7 mm Hg (95% CI \\u22126.9 to \\u22122.6; p\\u003c0.0001 and \\u22124.8 mm Hg (\\u20138.2 to \\u22121.5; p=0.0055), respectively)\"], [\"Riociguat group\", \"Placebo group\", \"Improvement of cardiac index in inoperable patients\", \"significantly increased\", \"Cardiac index improved in inoperable patients by a least-squares mean difference of +0.6 L/min/m2 (95% CI 0.4 to 0.7; p\\u003c0.0001), while in persistent/recurrent patients the change was +0.2 L/min/m2 (95% CI \\u22120.1 to 0.5; p=0.17).\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:34"}, "target": "[[\"Riociguat group\", \"Placebo group\", \"Improvement of cardiac index in persistent/recurrent patients\", \"no significant difference\", \"Cardiac index improved in inoperable patients by a least-squares mean difference of +0.6 L/min/m2 (95% CI 0.4 to 0.7; p\\u003c0.0001), while in persistent/recurrent patients the change was +0.2 L/min/m2 (95% CI \\u22120.1 to 0.5; p=0.17).\"], [\"Riociguat group\", \"Placebo group\", \"Pulmonary vascular resistance\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Riociguat decreased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in inoperable (n=189; least-squares mean difference: \\u2212285 dyn s/cm5 (95% CI \\u2212357 to \\u2212213); p\\u003c0.0001) and persistent/recurrent (n=72; \\u2212131 dyn s/cm5 (95% CI \\u2212214 to \\u221248); p=0.0025) patients.\"], [\"Riociguat group\", \"Placebo group\", \"Mean pulmonary artery pressure\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Mean pulmonary artery pressure decreased in inoperable and persistent/recurrent patients(\\u22124.7 mm Hg (95% CI \\u22126.9 to \\u22122.6; p\\u003c0.0001 and \\u22124.8 mm Hg (\\u20138.2 to \\u22121.5; p=0.0055), respectively)\"], [\"Riociguat group\", \"Placebo group\", \"Improvement of cardiac index in inoperable patients\", \"significantly increased\", \"Cardiac index improved in inoperable patients by a least-squares mean difference of +0.6 L/min/m2 (95% CI 0.4 to 0.7; p\\u003c0.0001), while in persistent/recurrent patients the change was +0.2 L/min/m2 (95% CI \\u22120.1 to 0.5; p=0.17).\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

However, the individual and combined effects of whey protein and carbohydrates on long-term resistance training adaptations are poorly understood.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: A four-week preparatory RT period was conducted in previously untrained males to standardize the training background of the subjects. Thereafter, the subjects were randomized into three groups: 30 g of whey proteins (n = 22), isocaloric carbohydrates (maltodextrin, n = 21), or protein + carbohydrates (n = 25). Within these groups, the subjects were further randomized into two whole-body 12-week RT regimens aiming either for muscle hypertrophy and maximal strength or muscle strength, hypertrophy and power. The post-exercise drink was always ingested immediately after the exercise bout, 2–3 times per week depending on the training period. Body composition (by DXA), quadriceps femoris muscle cross-sectional area (by panoramic ultrasound), maximal strength (by dynamic and isometric leg press) and serum lipids as basic markers of cardiovascular health, were analysed before and after the intervention.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Twelve-week RT led to increased fat-free mass, muscle size and strength independent of post-exercise nutrient intake (P < 0.05). However, the whey protein group reduced more total and abdominal area fat when compared to the carbohydrate group independent of the type of RT (P < 0.05). Thus, a larger relative increase (per kg bodyweight) in fat-free mass was observed in the protein vs. carbohydrate group (P < 0.05) without significant differences to the combined group. No systematic effects of the interventions were found for serum lipids. The RT type did not have an effect on the adaptations in response to different supplementation paradigms.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Post-exercise supplementation with whey proteins when compared to carbohydrates or combination of proteins and carbohydrates did not have a major effect on muscle size or strength when ingested two to three times a week. However, whey proteins may increase abdominal fat loss and relative fat-free mass adaptations in response to resistance training when compared to fast-acting carbohydrates.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"30\\u0026nbsp;g of whey proteins,\", \" isocaloric carbohydrates (maltodextrin)\", \"total and abdominal area fat\", \"significantly decreased\", \"However, the whey protein group reduced more total and abdominal area fat when compared to the carbohydrate group independent of the type of RT (P\\u2009\\u0026lt;\\u20090.05).\"], [\"30\\u0026nbsp;g of whey proteins,\", \" isocaloric carbohydrates (maltodextrin)\", \"total and abdominal area fat\", \"significantly decreased\", \"However, the whey protein group reduced more total and abdominal area fat when compared to the carbohydrate group independent of the type of RT (P\\u2009\\u003c\\u20090.05).\"], [\"30g of whey proteins,\", \" isocaloric carbohydrates (maltodextrin)\", \"fat-free mass\", \"significantly increased\", \"Thus, a larger relative increase (per kg bodyweight) in fat-free mass was observed in the protein vs. carbohydrate group (P\\u2009\\u0026lt;\\u20090.05) without significant differences to the combined group.\"], [\"30g of whey proteins,\", \" isocaloric carbohydrates (maltodextrin)\", \"fat-free mass\", \"significantly increased\", \"a larger relative increase (per kg bodyweight) in fat-free mass was observed in the protein vs. carbohydrate group (P\\u2009\\u003c\\u20090.05) without significant differences to the combined group.\"], [\"protein\\u2009+\\u2009carbohydrates\", \" isocaloric carbohydrates (maltodextrin)\", \"serum lipids\", \"no significant difference\", \"No systematic effects of the interventions were found for serum lipids.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

From the viewpoint of long-term continuity of activity, it is necessary to develop various cognitive stimulating programs. The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a cognitive intervention through a training program for picture book reading for community-dwelling older adults.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Fifty-eight Japanese older participants were divided into the intervention and control groups using simple randomization (n =29 vs 29). In the intervention group, participants took part in a program aimed at learning and mastering methods of picture book reading as a form of cognitive training intervention. The control group listened to lectures about elderly health maintenance. Cognitive tests were conducted individually before and after the programs.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The rate of memory retention, computed by dividing Logical Memory delayed recall by immediate recall, showed a significant interaction (p < .05) in analysis of covariance. Simple main effects showed that the rate of memory retention of the intervention group improved after the program completion (p < .05). In the participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) examined by Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-J) (n =14 vs 15), significant interactions were seen in Trail Making Test-A (p < .01), Trail Making Test-B (p < .05), Kana pick-out test (p < .05) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (p < .05).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: The intervention effect was found in delayed verbal memory. This program is also effective for improving attention and executive function in those with MCI. The short-term interventional findings suggest that this program might contribute to preventing a decline in memory and executive function.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN-CTR: UMIN000014712 (Date of ICMJE and WHO compliant trial information disclosure: 30 July 2014)\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"cognitive intervention through a training program for picture book reading for In the participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)\", \"control group\", \"rate of retention\", \"significantly increased\", \"The rate of memory retention, computed by dividing Logical Memory delayed recall by immediate recall, showed a significant interaction (p \\u003c .05) in analysis of covariance.\"], [\"cognitive intervention through a training program for picture book reading for In the participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)\", \"control group\", \"rate of retention\", \"significantly increased\", \"Simple main effects showed that the rate of memory retention of the intervention group improved after the program completion (p \\u003c .05).\"], [\"cognitive intervention through a training program for picture book reading for community-dwelling older adults.\", \"control group\", \"the rate of memory retention\", \"significantly increased\", \"Simple main effects showed that the rate of memory retention of the intervention group improved after the program completion (p \\u003c .05).\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:35"}, "target": "[[\"cognitive intervention through a training program for picture book reading for In the participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)\", \"control group\", \"rate of retention\", \"significantly increased\", \"The rate of memory retention, computed by dividing Logical Memory delayed recall by immediate recall, showed a significant interaction (p \\u003c .05) in analysis of covariance.\"], [\"cognitive intervention through a training program for picture book reading for In the participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)\", \"control group\", \"rate of retention\", \"significantly increased\", \"Simple main effects showed that the rate of memory retention of the intervention group improved after the program completion (p \\u003c .05).\"], [\"cognitive intervention through a training program for picture book reading for community-dwelling older adults.\", \"control group\", \"the rate of memory retention\", \"significantly increased\", \"Simple main effects showed that the rate of memory retention of the intervention group improved after the program completion (p \\u003c .05).\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

Applying an available and appropriate supplementary food is a major approach in treating children with Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM).\n\nABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of a new supplementary blended flour (containing chickpea, rice, wheat and barley, named Shadameen) in combination with multivitamin/mineral supplement and nutritional counseling versus multivitamin/mineral supplement and nutritional counseling alone, in the treatment of children with MAM.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: This randomized controlled trial study was conducted at Heshmatiyeh Hospital in Sabzevar city in Iran, from January 2016 to December 2016. Seventy infants, aged 9 to 24 months with MAM who were referred from urban health centers to the hospital clinic were included. They were randomly assigned to receive, for about 3 months, either multivitamin / mineral supplement and nutritional counseling alone or in combination with an extra supplementary blended food. We analyzed weight, length, weight for length Z score (WLZ), weight for age Z score (WAZ) and length for weight Z score (LAZ), along with recovery rate and adverse events among the two groups. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 16. We used statistics, Chi-square, independent t-test, and Fisher's exact test for the analyses of primary and secondary outcomes.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The food supplementation infant's mean weight and WLZ and WAZ were greater compared with the other group (0.81±0.29 gr and 0.55±0.33 gr, p=0.002), (0.36±0.36 and 0.02±0.52, p=0.003), (0.40±0.33 and 0.09±0.37, p=0.001). The recovery rate in the food supplemented group was significantly higher than the other group (68.4%, 31.6%, p=0.001). No adverse reactions were observed. There were no significant differences in LAZ at the end of the study between the two groups (p=0.53).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: This study showed that Shadameen in combination with multivitamin/mineral and counselling therapy can be more effective in decreasing the wasting rate of children with MAM than vitamin/mineral and counseling therapy alone.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (http://www.irct.ir) with the Irct ID: IRCT2015040921670N1.\n\nABSTRACT.FUNDING: This study was financially supported by the vice chancellor for research office, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"new supplementary blended flour (containing chickpea, rice, wheat and barley, named Shadameen)  \", \"multivitamin / mineral supplement and nutritional counseling alone\", \"The proportion of children who recovered\", \"significantly increased\", \"The food supplementation infant\\u2019s mean weight and WLZ and WAZ were greater compared with the other group (0.81\\u00b10.29 gr and 0.55\\u00b10.33 gr, p=0.002), (0.36\\u00b10.36 and 0.02\\u00b10.52, p=0.003), (0.40\\u00b10.33 and 0.09\\u00b10.37, p=0.001).

From the viewpoint of long-term continuity of activity, it is necessary to develop various cognitive stimulating programs. The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a cognitive intervention through a training program for picture book reading for community-dwelling older adults.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Fifty-eight Japanese older participants were divided into the intervention and control groups using simple randomization (n =29 vs 29). In the intervention group, participants took part in a program aimed at learning and mastering methods of picture book reading as a form of cognitive training intervention. The control group listened to lectures about elderly health maintenance. Cognitive tests were conducted individually before and after the programs.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The rate of memory retention, computed by dividing Logical Memory delayed recall by immediate recall, showed a significant interaction (p < .05) in analysis of covariance. Simple main effects showed that the rate of memory retention of the intervention group improved after the program completion (p < .05). In the participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) examined by Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-J) (n =14 vs 15), significant interactions were seen in Trail Making Test-A (p < .01), Trail Making Test-B (p < .05), Kana pick-out test (p < .05) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (p < .05).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: The intervention effect was found in delayed verbal memory. This program is also effective for improving attention and executive function in those with MCI. The short-term interventional findings suggest that this program might contribute to preventing a decline in memory and executive function.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN-CTR: UMIN000014712 (Date of ICMJE and WHO compliant trial information disclosure: 30 July 2014)\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"a cognitive intervention through a training program for picture book reading\", \"listening to lectures about elderly health maintenance\", \"rate of memory retention\", \"significantly increased\", \"The rate of memory retention, computed by dividing Logical Memory delayed recall by immediate recall, showed a significant interaction (p < .05) in analysis of covariance.

We evaluated flupirtine, a centrally acting analgesic, for producing perfect perioperative conditions in FESS for adults in a day-care setting.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:: Sixty-two patients (25–40 years) scheduled for FESS under general anesthesia were randomly divided into Group F (n = 31) receiving preoperative flupirtine (100 mg) and Group C (n = 31) receiving identical-looking placebo capsule per oral 60 min before induction of anesthesia. Perioperative Nasal bleeding and surgeon's satisfaction score during operation; amount and number of patients receiving fentanyl, propofol, and esmolol infusion for analgesia; maintenance of desired bispectral index (BIS) and deliberate hypotension, respectively.

This study aimed to determine the effects of dietary MH, delivered as an extract of un-ripened avocado, on energy expenditure (EE) in healthy adult Labrador Retriever dogs (total of 12 dogs, 26.99 ± 0.634 kg, 4.9 ± 0.2 y). The study was a double-blind, cross-over with each dog receiving both dietary treatments, control (CON) and MH (400 mg/kg of diet; 6 mg/kg BW), in random order. Resting and post-prandial (10 h) EE and respiratory quotient (RQ) were determined by indirect calorimetry (d 42). The following day, body composition was assessed using dual X-ray absorptiometry. Continuous activity monitoring was conducted using an Atical® accelerometer (d 43–47). A vastus lateralis muscle biopsy was obtained prior to the morning meal (d 49) and 4 h after consumption of their meal (d 56) to determine the protein content and phosphorylation of 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Diet did not affect body weight, resting EE or skeletal muscle AMPK phosphorylation. Dogs fed MH had significantly lower post-prandial RQ (p = 0.02) and ratio of fat to lean body mass (p = 0.02). Physical activity during light time periods (but not dark) was lower in dogs fed MH (p < 0.05) during weekends, but not on weekdays. These results suggest that MH affects energy balance of adult dogs, but that these effects are not dose dependent and not due to physical activity.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Mannoheptulose\", \"Control\", \"Body weight\", \"no significant difference\", \"Diet did not affect body weight, resting EE or skeletal muscle AMPK phosphorylation.\"], [\"Mannoheptulose\", \"Control\", \"Resting energy expenditure\", \"no significant difference\", \"Diet did not affect body weight, resting EE or skeletal muscle AMPK phosphorylation.\"], [\"Mannoheptulose\", \"Control\", \"Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase phosphorylation\", \"no significant difference\", \"Diet did not affect body weight, resting EE or skeletal muscle AMPK phosphorylation.\"], [\"Mannoheptulose\", \"Control\", \"Ratio of fat to lean body mass\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Dogs fed MH had significantly lower post-prandial RQ (p = 0.02) and ratio of fat to lean body mass (p = 0.02).\"], [\"Mannoheptulose\", \"Control\", \"Post-prandial respiratory quotient\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Dogs fed MH had significantly lower post-prandial RQ (p = 0.02) and ratio of fat to lean body mass (p = 0.02).\"], [\"Mannoheptulose\", \"Control\", \"Physical activity during light time periods\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Physical activity during light time periods (but not dark) was lower in dogs fed MH (p \\u003c 0.05) during weekends, but not on weekdays.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Dual release ciprofloxacin for inhalation (DRCFI) contains liposomal ciprofloxacin, formulated to optimise airway antibiotic delivery.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Phase II, 24-week Australian/New Zealand multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 42 adult bronchiectasis subjects with ≥2 pulmonary exacerbations in the prior 12 months and ciprofloxacin-sensitive P aeruginosa at screening. Subjects received DRCFI or placebo in three treatment cycles of 28 days on/28 days off. The primary outcome was change in sputum P aeruginosa bacterial density to the end of treatment cycle 1 (day 28), analysed by modified intention to treat (mITT). Key secondary outcomes included safety and time to first pulmonary exacerbation—after reaching the pulmonary exacerbation endpoint subjects discontinued study drug although remained in the study.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: DRCFI resulted in a mean (SD) 4.2 (3.7) log10 CFU/g reduction in P aeruginosa bacterial density at day 28 (vs −0.08 (3.8) with placebo, p=0.002). DRCFI treatment delayed time to first pulmonary exacerbation (median 134 vs 58 days, p=0.057 mITT, p=0.046 per protocol). DRCFI was well tolerated with a similar incidence of systemic adverse events to the placebo group, but fewer pulmonary adverse events.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily inhaled DRCFI demonstrated potent antipseudomonal microbiological efficacy in adults with non-CF bronchiectasis and ciprofloxacin-sensitive P aeruginosa.

To investigate how this alarming development can be counteracted, we conducted a randomized controlled trial evaluating a job coaching intervention to maintain the working capacity of members of staff and ultimately prevent sickness absence. Our sample included N = 99 employees who reported mental distress due to work-related problems. The intervention group (n = 58) received between 8 and 12 individual job coaching sessions in which they worked with a professional job coach to reduce their mental distress. The control group (n = 41) received a brochure about mental distress. Data were collected before the start of the study, at the end of the job coaching intervention, and at a 3-month follow-up. These data included the number of sickness absence days as the primary outcome and questionnaire measures to assess burnout indicators, life satisfaction, and work-related experiences and behaviors. Compared with the control group, the results indicated no reduction in sickness absence in the intervention group but fewer depressive symptoms, a heightened ability of the participants to distance themselves from work, more experience of work-related success, less depletion of emotional resources, and a greater satisfaction with life when participants had received the job coaching. Thus, although we could not detect a reduction in sickness absence between the groups, job coaching was shown to be a viable intervention technique to benefit employees by contributing to re-establish their mental health. We discuss the implications of the study and outline future research.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Job coaching sessions\", \"Control\", \"Sickness absence\", \"no significant difference\", \"Compared with the control group, the results indicated no reduction in sickness absence in the intervention group\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Dual release ciprofloxacin for inhalation (DRCFI) contains liposomal ciprofloxacin, formulated to optimise airway antibiotic delivery.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Phase II, 24-week Australian/New Zealand multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 42 adult bronchiectasis subjects with ≥2 pulmonary exacerbations in the prior 12 months and ciprofloxacin-sensitive P aeruginosa at screening. Subjects received DRCFI or placebo in three treatment cycles of 28 days on/28 days off. The primary outcome was change in sputum P aeruginosa bacterial density to the end of treatment cycle 1 (day 28), analysed by modified intention to treat (mITT). Key secondary outcomes included safety and time to first pulmonary exacerbation—after reaching the pulmonary exacerbation endpoint subjects discontinued study drug although remained in the study.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: DRCFI resulted in a mean (SD) 4.2 (3.7) log10 CFU/g reduction in P aeruginosa bacterial density at day 28 (vs −0.08 (3.8) with placebo, p=0.002). DRCFI treatment delayed time to first pulmonary exacerbation (median 134 vs 58 days, p=0.057 mITT, p=0.046 per protocol). DRCFI was well tolerated with a similar incidence of systemic adverse events to the placebo group, but fewer pulmonary adverse events.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily inhaled DRCFI demonstrated potent antipseudomonal microbiological efficacy in adults with non-CF bronchiectasis and ciprofloxacin-sensitive P aeruginosa. In this modest-sized phase II study, DRCFI was also well tolerated and delayed time to first pulmonary exacerbation in the per protocol population.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"Dual release ciprofloxacin for inhalation (DRCFI)\", \"placebo\", \"sputum P aeruginosa bacterial density\", \"significantly decreased\", \"DRCFI resulted in a mean (SD) 4.2 (3.7) log10 CFU/g reduction in P aeruginosa bacterial density at day 28 (vs −0.08 (3.8) with placebo, p=0.002).\"],\n    [\"Dual release ciprofloxacin for inhalation (DRCFI)\", \"placebo\", \"time to first pulmonary exacerbation\", \"significantly increased\", \"DRCFI treatment delayed time to first pulmonary exacerbation (median 134 vs 58 days, p=0.057 mITT, p=0.046 per protocol).\"],\n    [\"Dual release ciprofloxacin for inhalation (DRCFI)\", \"placebo\", \"pulmonary adverse events\", \"significantly decreased\", \"DRCFI was well tolerated with a similar incidence of systemic adverse events to the placebo group, but fewer pulmonary adverse events.\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"Dual release ciprofloxacin for inhalation (DRCFI)\", \"placebo\", \"sputum P aeruginosa bacterial density\", \"significantly decreased\", \"DRCFI resulted in a mean (SD) 4.2 (3.7) log10 CFU/g reduction in P aeruginosa bacterial density at day 28 (vs −0.08 (3.8) with placebo, p=0.002).\"],\n    [\"Dual release ciprofloxacin for inhalation (DRCFI)\", \"placebo\", \"time to first pulmonary exacerbation\", \"significantly increased\", \"DRCFI treatment delayed time to first pulmonary exacerbation (median 134 vs 58 days, p=0.057 mITT, p=0.046 per protocol).\"],\n    [\"Dual release ciprofloxacin for inhalation (DRCFI)\", \"placebo\", \"pulmonary adverse events\", \"significantly decreased\", \"DRCFI was well tolerated with a similar incidence of systemic adverse events to the placebo group, but fewer pulmonary adverse events.\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "b72864c47c0a833045e71328759b8b71a62742e45808a4a715328bab55896536", "prompt_hash": "90358bdab017f42bf3f4d57dcd2e26643f9278517964330d89b4a45e1e1f8473", "target_hash": "29452010ac203bb00debe0725d7709c90a5ddc2478441f6d3ebd833a9cf2a850", "bypass": null}

We designed this study to evaluate the efficiency of a traditional herbal preparation (Lax-Asab) in treating chronic constipation. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, participants with chronic constipation (n = 48) were randomly selected to receive either the Lax-Asab powder (n = 24) or placebo (n = 24) on alternative days for 4 weeks. The Lax-Asab powder contains equal amounts of Cassia angustifolia Vahl. (狹葉番瀉葉 xiá yè fān xiè yè), Mentha piperita L. (胡椒薄荷 hú jiāo bò hé), Zingiber officinale Rosc. (生薑 shēng jiāng), Glycyrrhiza glabra L. (甘草 gān cǎo). A total of 40 patients completed the study. We determined the severity of constipation based on defecation frequency (per week) and defecation difficulties. Of the total of 48 patients who participated, 40 completed the trial [24 men (60%), mean age, 21.0 ± 4.2 years; 16 women (40%), mean age, 20.1 ± 4.3 years]. The mean of weekly defecation frequency increased in both groups; from 1.8 ± 0.41 to 4.8 ± 1.12 times in patients who received Lax-Asab and from 1.7 ± 0.44 to 2.2 ± 0.61 times in patients who received placebo. A time–treatment interaction showed that this increase was significantly higher in the intervention group. Defecation difficulties improved significantly more in patients who received Lax-Asab than patients who received placebo. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups with regard to the side effects observed. This study confirms the efficacy and tolerability of an Iranian herbal preparation, Lax-Asab, in treating patients with chronic functional constipation.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Lax-Asab powder\", \"placebo\", \"efficacy of treating patients with chronic functional constipation\", \"significantly increased\", \"This study confirms the efficacy and tolerability of an Iranian herbal preparation, Lax-Asab, in treating patients with chronic functional constipation.\"], [\"Lax-Asab powder\", \"placebo\", \"mean of weekly defecation frequency increase\", \"significantly increased\", \"The mean of weekly defecation frequency increased in both groups; from 1.8 \\u00b1 0.41 to 4.8 \\u00b1 1.12 times in patients who received Lax-Asab and from 1.7 \\u00b1 0.44 to 2.2 \\u00b1 0.61 times in patients who received placebo.

The patients ranged in age from 7 to 49 years, with myopia of -0.75 to -6.0 diopters (D) and astigmatism of 1.25 to 4.0 D. After excluding 21 subjects, 23 subjects (39 eyes) were analyzed after toric orthokeratology lens use. The subjects underwent ophthalmologic examination after 1 day and 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks of wearing overnight toric orthokeratology lenses.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: A total of 19 subjects (31 eyes) completed the trial after five subjects (eight eyes) dropped out. In the patients who completed the study by wearing lenses for 4 weeks, the myopic refractive error decreased significantly by 2.60 ± 2.21 D (p < 0.001), from -3.65 ± 1.62 to -1.05 ± 1.64 D. The astigmatic refractive error were also significantly decreased by 0.63 ± 0.98 D (p = 0.001), from 2.07 ± 0.83 to 1.44 ± 0.99 D. The mean uncorrected and corrected visual acuities before wearing the lenses were 2.14 ± 0.80 logarithm of the logMAR (logMAR) and 0.05 ± 0.13 logMAR, respectively, which changed to 0.12 ± 0.30 logarithm of the logMAR (p < 0.001) and 0.01 ± 0.04 logMAR (p = 0.156) after 4 weeks.

Since endogenous melatonin levels are already reduced at preclinical AD stages, it is important to ask whether replenishing the missing hormone would be beneficial in AD and whether any such effects would be related to the presence of sleep disorder in patients.\n\nABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The effects of add-on prolonged-release melatonin (PRM) (2 mg) to standard therapy on cognitive functioning and sleep were investigated in 80 patients (men [50.7%], women [49.3%], average age 75.3 years [range, 52–85 years]) diagnosed with mild to moderate AD, with and without insomnia comorbidity, and receiving standard therapy (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with or without memantine). In this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, patients were treated for 2 weeks with placebo and then randomized (1:1) to receive 2 mg of PRM or placebo nightly for 24 weeks, followed by 2 weeks placebo. The AD Assessment Scale–Cognition (ADAS-Cog), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), Mini–Mental State Examination (MMSE), sleep, as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and a daily sleep diary, and safety parameters were measured.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Patients treated with PRM (24 weeks) had significantly better cognitive performance than those treated with placebo, as measured by the IADL (P=0.004) and MMSE (P=0.044). Mean ADAS-Cog did not differ between the groups. Sleep efficiency, as measured by the PSQI, component 4, was also better with PRM (P=0.017). In the comorbid insomnia (PSQI ≥6) subgroup, PRM treatment resulted in significant and clinically meaningful effects versus the placebo, in mean IADL (P=0.032), MMSE score (+1.5 versus −3 points) (P=0.0177), and sleep efficiency (P=0.04). Median ADAS-Cog values (−3.5 versus +3 points) (P=0.045) were significantly better with PRM. Differences were more significant at longer treatment duration. PRM was well tolerated, with an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Add-on PRM has positive effects on cognitive functioning and sleep maintenance in AD patients compared with placebo, particularly in those with insomnia comorbidity. The results suggest a possible causal link between poor sleep and cognitive decline.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Prolonged-release melatonin\", \"Placebo\", \"IADL cognitive performance \", \"significantly increased\", \"Patients treated with PRM (24 weeks) had significantly better cognitive performance than those treated with placebo, as measured by the IADL (P=0.004) and MMSE (P=0.044).\"], [\"Prolonged-release melatonin\", \"Placebo\", \"MMSE cognitive performance \", \"significantly increased\", \"Patients treated with PRM (24 weeks) had significantly better cognitive performance than those treated with placebo, as measured by the IADL (P=0.004) and MMSE (P=0.044).\"], [\"Prolonged-release melatonin\", \"Placebo\", \"Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index sleep efficiency\", \"significantly increased\", \"Sleep efficiency, as measured by the PSQI, component 4, was also better with PRM (P=0.017).\"], [\"Prolonged-release melatonin\", \"Placebo\", \"Adverse events \", \"no significant difference\", \"Differences were more significant at longer treatment duration.

The patients ranged in age from 7 to 49 years, with myopia of -0.75 to -6.0 diopters (D) and astigmatism of 1.25 to 4.0 D. After excluding 21 subjects, 23 subjects (39 eyes) were analyzed after toric orthokeratology lens use. The subjects underwent ophthalmologic examination after 1 day and 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks of wearing overnight toric orthokeratology lenses.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: A total of 19 subjects (31 eyes) completed the trial after five subjects (eight eyes) dropped out. In the patients who completed the study by wearing lenses for 4 weeks, the myopic refractive error decreased significantly by 2.60 ± 2.21 D (p < 0.001), from -3.65 ± 1.62 to -1.05 ± 1.64 D. The astigmatic refractive error were also significantly decreased by 0.63 ± 0.98 D (p = 0.001), from 2.07 ± 0.83 to 1.44 ± 0.99 D. The mean uncorrected and corrected visual acuities before wearing the lenses were 2.14 ± 0.80 logarithm of the logMAR (logMAR) and 0.05 ± 0.13 logMAR, respectively, which changed to 0.12 ± 0.30 logarithm of the logMAR (p < 0.001) and 0.01 ± 0.04 logMAR (p = 0.156) after 4 weeks. No serious adverse reactions were reported during the clinical trial.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that toric orthokeratology is an effective and safe treatment for correcting visual acuity in patients with combined myopia and astigmatism.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[[\"Toric orthokeratology lenses\", null, \"myopic refractive error\", \"significantly decreased\", \"myopic refractive error decreased significantly by 2.60 ± 2.21 D (p < 0.001), from -3.65 ± 1.62 to -1.05 ± 1.64 D.\"], [\"Toric orthokeratology lenses\", null, \"astigmatic refractive error\", \"significantly decreased\", \"astigmatic refractive error were also significantly decreased by 0.63 ± 0.98 D (p = 0.001), from 2.07 ± 0.83 to 1.44 ± 0.99 D.\"], [\"Toric orthokeratology lenses\", null, \"uncorrected visual acuity\", \"significantly increased\", \"the mean uncorrected visual acuity changed to 0.12 ± 0.30 logarithm of the logMAR (p < 0.001) after 4 weeks.\"], [\"Toric orthokeratology lenses\", null, \"corrected visual acuity\", \"significantly increased\", \"the mean corrected visual acuity changed to 0.01 ± 0.04 logMAR (p = 0.156) after 4 weeks.\"]]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[[\"Toric orthokeratology lenses\", null, \"myopic refractive error\", \"significantly decreased\", \"myopic refractive error decreased significantly by 2.60 ± 2.21 D (p < 0.001), from -3.65 ± 1.62 to -1.05 ± 1.64 D.\"], [\"Toric orthokeratology lenses\", null, \"astigmatic refractive error\", \"significantly decreased\", \"astigmatic refractive error were also significantly decreased by 0.63 ± 0.98 D (p = 0.001), from 2.07 ± 0.83 to 1.44 ± 0.99 D.\"], [\"Toric orthokeratology lenses\", null, \"uncorrected visual acuity\", \"significantly increased\", \"the mean uncorrected visual acuity changed to 0.12 ± 0.30 logarithm of the logMAR (p < 0.001) after 4 weeks.\"], [\"Toric orthokeratology lenses\", null, \"corrected visual acuity\", \"significantly increased\", \"the mean corrected visual acuity changed to 0.01 ± 0.04 logMAR (p = 0.156) after 4 weeks.\"]]"], "doc_hash": "491b4567764c4e232300835f57e538d398209f058f783bebc040e5495aac8f6e", "prompt_hash": "4f0f03b1f9ac19ffea02abb38b949a239d3661eeaf5e87238b56ae35158bbacb", "target_hash": "e404371bb5ecd78cf8aa4394a5c07c5e47f088cf53a95e4722487e0b0afb97c4", "bypass": null}

In this retrospective pooled analysis of these studies we assessed whether the zofenopril effect is influenced by gender.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: the four double-blind, randomized, parallel-group SMILE studies, compared the efficacy and safety of 6–48 week treatment with zofenopril 60 mg/day with that of placebo, lisinopril 10 mg/day or ramipril 10 mg/day in 3630 AMI patients. This pooled analysis compared treatment efficacy (1-year combined occurrence of death or hospitalization for CV causes) in 2733 men and 897 women.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: women were older than men, had a higher prevalence of diabetes and of other major CV risk factors. The risk of a major CV event was significantly larger for women (23% vs. 17% men, p<0.001). Between-gender risk difference was more marked for people living in Southern (+54%) than in Northern Europe (+12%). In both genders zofenopril similarly reduced the 1-year risk of CV morbidity and mortality vs. placebo (−39% men, p = 0.0001; −40% women, p = 0.005). The risk reduction was more marked with zofenopril than with the other ACEIs, particularly in men (−27%, p = 0.012; women: −14%, p = 0.479). The drug safety profile was similar between genders in zofenopril-treated patients, while it was worse in women treated with other ACEIs.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: post-AMI women are at higher risk of CV complications than men, particularly when living in Mediterranean countries. Their response to ACE-inhibition varies according to the type of drug and is usually better in men.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"zofenopril 60 mg/day\", \"placebo\", \"risk of 1-year CV morbidity and mortality \", \"significantly decreased\", \"In both genders zofenopril similarly reduced the 1-year risk of CV morbidity and mortality vs. placebo (\\u221239% men, p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0001; \\u221240% women, p\\u200a=\\u200a0.005).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

At the time of this study, artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and chlorproguanil-dapsone (CPD), both multi-dose regimes, were considered possible alternatives to SP in Malawi. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of poor adherence on the effectiveness of AL and CPD.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Children ≥12 months and adults with uncomplicated malaria were randomized to receive AL, CPD or SP. Adherence was measured using a questionnaire and electronic monitoring devices, MEMSTM, pill bottles that recorded the date and time of opening. Day-7 plasma dapsone or lumefantrine concentrations were measured to examine their relationship with adherence and clinical response.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: 841 patients were recruited. The day-28 adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) rates, using intention to treat analysis (missing data treated as failure), were AL 85.2%, CPD 63.7% and SP 50%. ACPR rates for AL were higher than CPD or SP on days 28 and 42 (p ≤ 0.002 for all comparisons). CPD was more effective than SP on day-28 (p = 0.01), but not day-42. <p> Very high adherence was reported using the questionnaire, 100% for AL treated patients and 99.2% for the CPD group. Only three CPD participants admitted missing any doses. 164/181 (90.6%) of CPD treated patients took all their doses out of the MEMSTM container and they were more likely to have a day-28 ACPR than those who did not take all their medication out of the container, p = 0.024. Only 7/87 (8%) AL treated patients did not take all of their doses out of their MEMSTM container and none had treatment failure. <p> Median day-7 dapsone concentrations were higher in CPD treated patients with ACPR than in treatment failures, p = 0.012. There were no differences in day-7 dapsone or lumefantrine concentrations between those who took all their doses from the MEMSTM container and those who did not. A day-7 lumefantrine concentration reported to be predictive of AL treatment failure in Thailand was not useful in this population; only one of 16 participants with a concentration below this threshold (175 ng/ml) had treatment failure.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: This study provides reassurance of the effectiveness of AL, even with unsupervised dosing, as it is rolled out across sub-Saharan Africa. Self-reported adherence appears to be an unreliable measure of adherence in this population.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"Chlorproguanil-dapsone (CPD)\", \"Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) \", \"Effectiveness at day 28\", \"significantly increased\", \"CPD was more effective than SP on day-28 (p = 0.01), but not day-42.\"], [\"Chlorproguanil-dapsone (CPD)\", \"Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) \", \"Effectiveness at day 42\", \"no significant difference\", \"CPD was more effective than SP on day-28 (p = 0.01), but not day-42.\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:40"}, "target": "[[\"Chlorproguanil-dapsone (CPD)\", \"Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) \", \"Effectiveness at day 28\", \"significantly increased\", \"CPD was more effective than SP on day-28 (p = 0.01), but not day-42.\"], [\"Chlorproguanil-dapsone (CPD)\", \"Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) \", \"Effectiveness at day 42\", \"no significant difference\", \"CPD was more effective than SP on day-28 (p = 0.01), but not day-42.\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

Here, a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study examined the effect of olanzapine (an atypical antipsychotic) augmentation therapy on sleep architecture, specifically slow wave sleep (SWS), in the treatment of depression. The effect of olanzapine augmentation therapy on other features of sleep (e.g., sleep continuity) and depression (e.g., illness severity and cognitive function) were also determined.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Patients currently experiencing a major depressive episode and who were on a stable medication were included. Sleep architecture was measured by overnight ambulatory polysomnography. Illness severity was determined using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Cognitive function was examined using Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB): Spatial Working Memory (SWM), Spatial Span (SSP), and Reaction Time (RTI) tasks. Polysomnographs, clinical measures and cognitive tests were administered at baseline, after 2–4 days of treatment and after 28–31 days of treatment. Twenty-five patients participated in the study (N = 10, N = 15 for placebo and olanzapine treated groups respectively).\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The primary objective of the study was to assess the objective (polysomnographic) changes in sleep quality, defined as changes in SWS, following olanzapine treatment for depression. Latency to but not duration of SWS was found to significantly differ between olanzapine- and placebo-treated participants (Hedge's g: 0.97, 0.13 respectively). A significant improvement in olanzapine-treated participants over placebo-treated participants was observed in secondary outcome measures, including sleep efficiency, total sleep time, and sleep latency. Secondary objectives assessed the subjective changes in sleep quality parameters and correlated them with measures of illness severity and changes in cognition. MADRS scores were significantly improved in olanzapine-treated participants over time but not more than placebo treatment. There was no significant difference between olanzapine- and placebo-treated participants in SWM, SSP or RTI tasks.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine augmentation treatment generally did not improve SWS but did improve sleep continuity and depression. Olanzapine may be one of few medications that improve sleep continuity, thus directly targeting symptoms of depression.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov,\nNCT00520507.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"olanzapine\", \"placebo\", \"sleep efficiency \", \"significantly increased\", \"A significant improvement in olanzapine-treated participants over placebo-treated participants was observed in secondary outcome measures, including sleep efficiency, total sleep time, and sleep latency.\"], [\"olanzapine\", \"placebo\", \"Spatial Working Memory (SWM), Spatial Span (SSP), and Reaction Time (RTI) tasks\", \"no significant difference\", \"There was no significant difference between olanzapine- and placebo-treated participants in SWM, SSP or RTI tasks.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

At the time of this study, artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and chlorproguanil-dapsone (CPD), both multi-dose regimes, were considered possible alternatives to SP in Malawi. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of poor adherence on the effectiveness of AL and CPD.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Children ≥12 months and adults with uncomplicated malaria were randomized to receive AL, CPD or SP. Adherence was measured using a questionnaire and electronic monitoring devices, MEMSTM, pill bottles that recorded the date and time of opening. Day-7 plasma dapsone or lumefantrine concentrations were measured to examine their relationship with adherence and clinical response.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: 841 patients were recruited. The day-28 adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) rates, using intention to treat analysis (missing data treated as failure), were AL 85.2%, CPD 63.7% and SP 50%. ACPR rates for AL were higher than CPD or SP on days 28 and 42 (p ≤ 0.002 for all comparisons). CPD was more effective than SP on day-28 (p = 0.01), but not day-42. <p> Very high adherence was reported using the questionnaire, 100% for AL treated patients and 99.2% for the CPD group. Only three CPD participants admitted missing any doses. 164/181 (90.6%) of CPD treated patients took all their doses out of the MEMSTM container and they were more likely to have a day-28 ACPR than those who did not take all their medication out of the container, p = 0.024. Only 7/87 (8%) AL treated patients did not take all of their doses out of their MEMSTM container and none had treatment failure. <p> Median day-7 dapsone concentrations were higher in CPD treated patients with ACPR than in treatment failures, p = 0.012. There were no differences in day-7 dapsone or lumefantrine concentrations between those who took all their doses from the MEMSTM container and those who did not. A day-7 lumefantrine concentration reported to be predictive of AL treatment failure in Thailand was not useful in this population; only one of 16 participants with a concentration below this threshold (175 ng/ml) had treatment failure.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: This study provides reassurance of the effectiveness of AL, even with unsupervised dosing, as it is rolled out across sub-Saharan Africa. Self-reported adherence appears to be an unreliable measure of adherence in this population.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[[\"artemether-lumefantrine\", \"chlorproguanil-dapsone\", \"adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) rate\", \"significantly increased\", \"ACPR rates for AL were higher than CPD or SP on days 28 and 42 (p ≤ 0.002 for all comparisons).\"], [\"artemether-lumefantrine\", \"sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine\", \"adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) rate\", \"significantly increased\", \"ACPR rates for AL were higher than SP on days 28 and 42 (p ≤ 0.002 for all comparisons).\"]]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[[\"artemether-lumefantrine\", \"chlorproguanil-dapsone\", \"adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) rate\", \"significantly increased\", \"ACPR rates for AL were higher than CPD or SP on days 28 and 42 (p ≤ 0.002 for all comparisons).\"], [\"artemether-lumefantrine\", \"sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine\", \"adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) rate\", \"significantly increased\", \"ACPR rates for AL were higher than SP on days 28 and 42 (p ≤ 0.002 for all comparisons).\"]]"], "doc_hash": "887aa4bb18ab92975852a83751397fd65b00e1e6ac6c05956008370cb16419cd", "prompt_hash": "4a9e616a46afbc01ae752590a869e29df3bb329f822e766cf904097d7e61cfc9", "target_hash": "62adf73030ae0b5716f6158504c27dfb6d514110abd3675f0c42202b9e10ac09", "bypass": null}

Methods. RP patients having at least 7 attacks per week were stratified by primary and secondary RP and within secondary by systemic sclerosis or other connective tissue disease. Subjects completed a daily standardized diary recording all RP attacks (frequency, duration and severity). Serum levels of 18 inflammatory and angiogenic cytokines were measured pre- and post-treatment. Results. Eighteen patients completed the study; 8 received SJW and 10 placebo. The decrease in mean number of attacks per day was 0.75 with SJW and 1.01 with placebo, P = 0.06. Attack duration and severity were not different between groups. Cytokine analyses demonstrated no between-groups differences. Combining treatment groups, those with >50% improvement in frequency of attacks yielded a significant increase in E-selectin (P = 0.049), MMP-9 (P = 0.011), G-CSF (P = 0.02), and VEGF (P = 0.012) pre- versus post-treatment. A ≥50% improvement in severity of attacks corresponded to a significant increase in levels of sVCAM-1 (P = 0.003), sICAM-1 (P = 0.007), and MCP-1 (P = 0.004). Conclusions.

Actual exposure to CT interventions is not living up to its high expectations, as only a (limited) proportion of the target group is actually using these programs.\n\nABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE: To investigate exposure to an Internet-delivered, CT lifestyle intervention, targeting physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, smoking behavior, and alcohol intake, we focused on three processes: first use, prolonged use, and sustained use. The first objectives were to identify user characteristics that predict initiation of an online CT lifestyle program (first use) and completion of this program (prolonged use). Furthermore, we studied the effect of using a proactive strategy, consisting of periodic email prompts, on program revisits (sustained use).\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: The research population for this study consisted of Dutch adults participating in the Adult Health Monitor, offered by the regional public health services. We used a randomized controlled trial design to assess predictors of first use, prolonged use, and sustained use. Demographics and behavioral characteristics, as well as the strategy used for revisiting, were included as predictors in the model.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: A total of 9169 participants indicated their interest in the new program and 5168 actually logged in to the program. Participants significantly more likely to initiate one of the CT modules were male, older, and employed, and had a lower income, higher body mass index, and relatively unhealthy lifestyle. Participants significantly more likely to complete one of the CT modules were older and had a higher income and a relatively healthier lifestyle. Finally, using a proactive strategy influenced sustained use, with people from the prompting condition being more likely to revisit the program (odds ratio 28.92, 95% confidence interval 10.65–78.52; P < .001).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Older, male, and employed participants, and those with a lower income, higher body mass index, and a relatively unhealthy lifestyle were more likely to initiate a CT module. Module completers predominantly had a higher income and age. The current program therefore succeeded in reaching those people who benefit most from online lifestyle interventions. However, these people tended to disengage from the program. This underlines the importance of additional research into program adjustments and strategies that can be used to stimulate prolonged program use. Furthermore, sending periodic email prompts significantly increased revisits to the program. Though promising, this effect was modest and needs to be further examined, in order to maximize the potential of periodic email prompting.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Nederlands Trial Register (NTR: 1786) and Medical Ethics Committee of Maastricht University and the University Hospital Maastricht (NL2723506809/MEC0903016); http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=1786 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/65hBXA6V7)\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Periodic Email Prompt\", \"Control\", \"Revisiting the program\", \"significantly increased\", \"Finally, using a proactive strategy influenced sustained use, with people from the prompting condition being more likely to revisit the program (odds ratio 28.92, 95% confidence interval 10.65\\u201378.52; P \\u003c .001).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Since MS is an inflammatory disease and Boswellia papyrifera has anti-inflammatory effects, the influence of B. papyrifera on cognitive impairment in MS patients has been investigated in the present study. <p> \nMethods: In this clinical trial, 80 MS patients who referred to the clinic of Shafa Hospital, Kerman, Iran were selected. Having completed a written consent form, patients with relapsing remitting MS, with no occurrence of a new attack throughout 1 month before the study, with no pregnancy or breastfeeding entered the study. The patients were randomly divided into two groups; then Brief International Cognitive Assessment for MS (BICAMS) test was carried out. One group received B. papyrifera (capsule 300 mg, twice a day) while the other group received placebo with the same dose for 2 months. After 2 months of treatment, BICAMS was redone and changes were analyzed. The significant change value on the before-after BICAMS points were considered to be 8, 13, and 7 points for the symbol digit modality test (SDMT), the California verbal learning test (CVLT), and the brief visual-spatial memory test revised (BVMT-R), respectively. <p> \nResults: The patients' mean age was 36.58 8.50 years.

We designed this study to evaluate the efficiency of a traditional herbal preparation (Lax-Asab) in treating chronic constipation. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, participants with chronic constipation (n = 48) were randomly selected to receive either the Lax-Asab powder (n = 24) or placebo (n = 24) on alternative days for 4 weeks. The Lax-Asab powder contains equal amounts of Cassia angustifolia Vahl. (狹葉番瀉葉 xiá yè fān xiè yè), Mentha piperita L. (胡椒薄荷 hú jiāo bò hé), Zingiber officinale Rosc. (生薑 shēng jiāng), Glycyrrhiza glabra L. (甘草 gān cǎo). A total of 40 patients completed the study. We determined the severity of constipation based on defecation frequency (per week) and defecation difficulties. Of the total of 48 patients who participated, 40 completed the trial [24 men (60%), mean age, 21.0 ± 4.2 years; 16 women (40%), mean age, 20.1 ± 4.3 years]. The mean of weekly defecation frequency increased in both groups; from 1.8 ± 0.41 to 4.8 ± 1.12 times in patients who received Lax-Asab and from 1.7 ± 0.44 to 2.2 ± 0.61 times in patients who received placebo. A time–treatment interaction showed that this increase was significantly higher in the intervention group. Defecation difficulties improved significantly more in patients who received Lax-Asab than patients who received placebo. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups with regard to the side effects observed. This study confirms the efficacy and tolerability of an Iranian herbal preparation, Lax-Asab, in treating patients with chronic functional constipation.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Lax-Asab powder\", \"placebo\", \"efficacy of treating patients with chronic functional constipation\", \"significantly increased\", \"This study confirms the efficacy and tolerability of an Iranian herbal preparation, Lax-Asab, in treating patients with chronic functional constipation.\"], [\"Lax-Asab powder\", \"placebo\", \"mean of weekly defecation frequency increase\", \"significantly increased\", \"The mean of weekly defecation frequency increased in both groups; from 1.8 \\u00b1 0.41 to 4.8 \\u00b1 1.12 times in patients who received Lax-Asab and from 1.7 \\u00b1 0.44 to 2.2 \\u00b1 0.61 times in patients who received placebo.

Since MS is an inflammatory disease and Boswellia papyrifera has anti-inflammatory effects, the influence of B. papyrifera on cognitive impairment in MS patients has been investigated in the present study. <p> \nMethods: In this clinical trial, 80 MS patients who referred to the clinic of Shafa Hospital, Kerman, Iran were selected. Having completed a written consent form, patients with relapsing remitting MS, with no occurrence of a new attack throughout 1 month before the study, with no pregnancy or breastfeeding entered the study. The patients were randomly divided into two groups; then Brief International Cognitive Assessment for MS (BICAMS) test was carried out. One group received B. papyrifera (capsule 300 mg, twice a day) while the other group received placebo with the same dose for 2 months. After 2 months of treatment, BICAMS was redone and changes were analyzed. The significant change value on the before-after BICAMS points were considered to be 8, 13, and 7 points for the symbol digit modality test (SDMT), the California verbal learning test (CVLT), and the brief visual-spatial memory test revised (BVMT-R), respectively. <p> \nResults: The patients' mean age was 36.58 8.50 years. The mean duration of disease was 7.41 4.13 years. About 84.2% (n = 64) of the patients was female. In the BVMT-R, 13 patients (34.2%), who had already taken B. papyrifera, were shown to have significant improvement compared to the placebo group with no improvement (P < 0. 001). About 12 and 8 patients in the treatment and placebo groups in the SDMT, respectively (P = 0.200) and 17 and 12 patients in the treatment and placebo groups in the CVLT, respectively (P = 0.170) had significant change values. <p> \nConclusion: \nB. papyrifera showed significant improvement in visuospatial memory, but had no effect on verbal memory and information processing speed.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[[\"Boswellia papyrifera\", \"placebo\", \"visuospatial memory\", \"significantly increased\", \"13 patients (34.2%), who had already taken B. papyrifera, were shown to have significant improvement compared to the placebo group with no improvement (P < 0.001).\"], [\"Boswellia papyrifera\", \"placebo\", \"verbal memory\", \"no significant difference\", \"About 12 and 8 patients in the treatment and placebo groups in the SDMT, respectively (P = 0.200)\"], [\"Boswellia papyrifera\", \"placebo\", \"information processing speed\", \"no significant difference\", \"About 17 and 12 patients in the treatment and placebo groups in the CVLT, respectively (P = 0.170)\"]]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[[\"Boswellia papyrifera\", \"placebo\", \"visuospatial memory\", \"significantly increased\", \"13 patients (34.2%), who had already taken B. papyrifera, were shown to have significant improvement compared to the placebo group with no improvement (P < 0.001).\"], [\"Boswellia papyrifera\", \"placebo\", \"verbal memory\", \"no significant difference\", \"About 12 and 8 patients in the treatment and placebo groups in the SDMT, respectively (P = 0.200)\"], [\"Boswellia papyrifera\", \"placebo\", \"information processing speed\", \"no significant difference\", \"About 17 and 12 patients in the treatment and placebo groups in the CVLT, respectively (P = 0.170)\"]]"], "doc_hash": "733bb1a53a1760955ae4ddf094609e3e3d6b0851e1fab6bced0aeb871581c5b5", "prompt_hash": "97370a5f7c4fd0b9edfd79a3222a44dcb00ab22f9096f89aa5de530bf2a1fe9f", "target_hash": "7a22e979c72db2ef93fbd77cfc88f816f92ab7e0b390e76fa90e16937a87013a", "bypass": null}

These neonates should reach an independent oral nutrition stage before being discharged from the Neonatal Intensive care Unit. Therefore, the researcher decided to conduct a study on the effect of palady and cup feeding on premature neonates' weight gain and their reaching full oral feeding time interval.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:: This is a clinical trial with a quantitative design conducted on 69 premature infants (gestational age between 29 and 32 weeks) who were assigned to cup (n = 34) and palady (n = 35) feeding groups through random allocation. The first feeding was administrated either by cup or palady method in each shift within seven sequential days (total of 21 cup and palady feedings).

A total of 106 selected infertile male patients with bacteriologically cured chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were randomly prescribed rifaximin (200 mg, 2 tablets bid, for 7 days monthly for 12 months) and probiotic containing multiple strains VSL#3 (450 × 109 CFU per day) or no treatment. Ninety-five of them (89.6%) complied with the therapeutic plan and were included in this study. Group A = \"6Tx/6-\": treatment for the initial 6 and no treatment for the following 6 months (n = 26); Group B = \"12Tx\": 12 months of treatment (n = 22); Group C = \"6-/6Tx\": no treatment for the initial 6 months and treatment in the last 6 months (n = 23); Group D = \"12-\": no treatment (n = 24). The patients of Groups A = \"6Tx/6-\" and B = \"12Tx\" had the highest frequency of chronic prostatitis (88.5% and 86.4%, respectively). In contrast, group \"12-\": patients had the lowest frequency of prostatitis (33.4%). The progression of prostatitis into PV in groups \"6Tx/6-\" (15.5%) and \"6-/6Tx\" (13.6%) was lower than that found in the patients of group \"12-\" (45.8%). Finally, no patient of groups \"6Tx/6-\" and \"6-/6Tx\" had PVE, whereas it was diagnosed in 20.8% of group \"12-\" patients. Long-term treatment with rifaximin and the probiotic VSL#3 is effective in lowering the progression of prostatitis into more complicated forms of male accessory gland infections in infertile patients with bacteriologically cured CBP plus IBS.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"rifaximin followed by the probiotic VSL#3\", \"no treatment\", \"progression of chronic prostatitis plus IBS toward chronic microbial prostate-vesiculitis (PV) or prostate-vesiculo-epididymitis (PVE) in infertile males\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Long-term treatment with rifaximin and the probiotic VSL#3 is effective in lowering the progression of prostatitis into more complicated forms of male accessory gland infections\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

A randomized controlled trial was conducted among 2-1-1 callers (n = 500) assigned to control or intervention conditions. 2-1-1 information and referral specialists collected baseline data and delivered the intervention consisting of 3 mailings and 1 coaching call; university-based data collectors conducted follow-up interviews at 3 and 6 months post-baseline. Data were collected from June 2013 through July 2014. Participants were mostly female (87.2%), African American (61.4%), and smokers (76.6%). Participants assigned to the intervention condition were more likely than controls to report a full ban on smoking in the home at both 3- (38.1% vs 19.3%, p = < .001) and 6-month follow-up (43.2% vs 33.2%, p = .02). The longitudinal intent-to-treat analysis showed a significant intervention effect over time (OR = 1.31, p = .001), i.e. OR = 1.72 at 6 months. This study replicates prior findings showing the effectiveness of the minimal intervention to promote smoke-free homes in low-income households, and extends those findings by demonstrating they can be achieved when 2-1-1 information and referral specialists deliver the intervention.

This difference was entirely attributable to a difference between the two measures during the nocturnal period. Nocturnal gastric acid breakthrough was not a useful predictor of pathologic nocturnal esophageal reflux.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: In GERD subjects treated with a PPI, measuring time esophageal pH < 4 will significantly overestimate the prevalence of pathologic esophageal acid exposure over 24 hours and during the nocturnal period.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"integrated acidity\", \"time pH \\u003c 4\", \"the prevalence of pathologic 24-hour esophageal reflux\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The prevalence of pathologic 24-hour esophageal reflux in both studies was significantly higher when measured as time pH \\u003c 4 than when measured as integrated acidity\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

A randomized controlled trial was conducted among 2-1-1 callers (n = 500) assigned to control or intervention conditions. 2-1-1 information and referral specialists collected baseline data and delivered the intervention consisting of 3 mailings and 1 coaching call; university-based data collectors conducted follow-up interviews at 3 and 6 months post-baseline. Data were collected from June 2013 through July 2014. Participants were mostly female (87.2%), African American (61.4%), and smokers (76.6%). Participants assigned to the intervention condition were more likely than controls to report a full ban on smoking in the home at both 3- (38.1% vs 19.3%, p = < .001) and 6-month follow-up (43.2% vs 33.2%, p = .02). The longitudinal intent-to-treat analysis showed a significant intervention effect over time (OR = 1.31, p = .001), i.e. OR = 1.72 at 6 months. This study replicates prior findings showing the effectiveness of the minimal intervention to promote smoke-free homes in low-income households, and extends those findings by demonstrating they can be achieved when 2-1-1 information and referral specialists deliver the intervention. Findings offer support for this intervention as a generalizable and scalable model for reducing secondhand smoke exposure in homes.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[[\"minimal Smoke-Free Homes intervention delivered by 2-1-1 specialists\", \"control condition\", \"adoption of home smoking bans\", \"significantly increased\", \"Participants assigned to the intervention condition were more likely than controls to report a full ban on smoking in the home at both 3- (38.1% vs 19.3%, p = < .001) and 6-month follow-up (43.2% vs 33.2%, p = .02).

Because a low-fat plant-based diet has been shown to improve glycemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes, we hypothesized that such a diet would reduce painful symptoms of diabetic neuropathy.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS:: In this 20-week pilot study, individuals with type 2 diabetes and painful diabetic neuropathy were randomly assigned to two groups. The intervention group was asked to follow a low-fat, plant-based diet, with weekly classes for support in following the prescribed diet, and to take a vitamin B12 supplement. The control group was asked to take the same vitamin B12 supplement, but received no other intervention. At baseline, midpoint and 20 weeks, clinical, laboratory and questionnaire data were collected. Questionnaires included an analog 'worst pain' scale, Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument, global impression scale, Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire, Neuropathy Total Symptom Score, a weekly pain diary and Norfolk Quality of Life Questionnaire.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: After 20 weeks, body weight change with the intervention was −6.4 kg (95% confidence interval (CI) −9.4 to −3.4, P<0.001) in an effect size analysis.

Meeting specific physical criteria of 100% relative humidity (RH) and temperature of 37°C are the basic interventional requirements to administer oxygen for the newborns through a nasal cannula. Recently, two systems, MR850 and PMH7000, received the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to administer heated, humidified HFNC (HHHFNC). These systems are evaluated in this study based on their humidifying and heating capabilities.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:: This study was done as an RCT on newborns weighing 1,000 to 1,500 g recovering from respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) while nCPAP was administered at CDP = 4 cmH2O, Fio2 <30%. Patients were randomized to two groups of 35 receiving HHHFNC after treatment with nCPAP, with one group using MR850 humidifier and the other PMH7000. The patients were compared according to the duration of HHHFNC administration, repeated need for nCPAP respiratory support, the need for invasive ventilation, apnea, chronic lung disease (CLD), nasal trauma, RH, and temperature of the gases.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: The average time of support with HHHNFC did not show any significant difference in the two groups. There was no significant difference between the groups in the need for nCPAP, invasive ventilation, apnea, nasal trauma, and CLD. The difference in the levels of average temperature and humidity was significant (P value <0.001).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: Although the records of temperature and RH in the PMH7000 system was lower than the records from the MR850 system, no clinical priority was observed for respiratory support with HHHNFC in the two systems.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"PMH7000\", \"MR850\", \"severity of the mucosa injury\", \"no significant difference\", \"There was no significant difference between the groups in the need for nCPAP, invasive ventilation, apnea, nasal trauma, and CLD.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of 850‐nm gallium arsenide aluminum (Ga‐As‐Al) laser therapy on pain, range of motion and disability in subacromial impingement syndrome.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS:: A total of 52 patients (33 females and 19 males with a mean age of 53.59±11.34 years) with subacromial impingement syndrome were included. The patients were randomly assigned into two groups. Group I (n = 30, laser group) received laser therapy (5 joule/cm2 at each point over maximum 5‐6 painful points for 1 minute). Group II (n = 22, placebo laser group) received placebo laser therapy. Initially cold pack (10 minutes) was applied to all of the patients. Also patients were given an exercise program including range of motion, stretching and progressive resistive exercises. The therapy program was applied 5 times a week for 14 sessions. Pain severity was assessed by using visual analogue scale. Range of motion was measured by goniometer. Disability was evaluated by using Shoulder Pain and Disability Index.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: In group I, statistically significant improvements in pain severity, range of motion except internal and external rotation and SPADI scores were observed compared to baseline scores after the therapy (p<0.05).

It was performed among 146 hypertensive women of 30-65 age range who referred to 6 health care centers of Isfahan that randomly assigned to a control and intervention groups. The interventional group participated in the 6 weekly sessions including exercises, weight control, medication adherence, and home self-monitoring based on goal setting, and promotion of self-efficacy. The control group received routine care from health-care center and any special intervention has been done for the control group. Output variables were analyzed after intervention, and 6-month follow-up.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: There are no significant differences between age, weight, body mass index and BP and biochemical variables except lipids as well as behavioral factors at the baseline. After 6 months intervention self-efficacy (< 0.001) and physical activity (< 0.001) improvement of in the intervention group was significantly different in comparison with the control group. After 6 months, there was a significant reduction in systolic (P < 0.001) and diastolic BP (P = 0.010) in the intervention group.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Participatory method of education could help us to convince patients to have better self-care to control disease. Furthermore, since adherence to the treatment of hypertensive patients in our society is low, organizing such courses can teach essential knowledge and skills to lifestyle change and prevention of complications. Performing these courses is recommended for other chronic disease patients in health-care centers to assess self-management programs on self-care behavior.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"6 weekly sessions including exercises, weight control, medication adherence, and home self-monitoring\", \"routine care from health-care center\", \"average of physical activity\", \"significantly increased\", \"After 6 months intervention self-efficacy (\\u003c 0.001) and physical activity (\\u003c 0.001) improvement of in the intervention group was significantly different in comparison with the control group.\"], [\"6 weekly sessions including exercises, weight control, medication adherence, and home self-monitoring\", \"routine care from health-care center\", \"systolic and diastolic BP\", \"significantly decreased\", \"After 6 months, there was a significant reduction in systolic (P \\u003c 0.001) and diastolic BP (P = 0.010) in the intervention group.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of 850‐nm gallium arsenide aluminum (Ga‐As‐Al) laser therapy on pain, range of motion and disability in subacromial impingement syndrome.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS:: A total of 52 patients (33 females and 19 males with a mean age of 53.59±11.34 years) with subacromial impingement syndrome were included. The patients were randomly assigned into two groups. Group I (n = 30, laser group) received laser therapy (5 joule/cm2 at each point over maximum 5‐6 painful points for 1 minute). Group II (n = 22, placebo laser group) received placebo laser therapy. Initially cold pack (10 minutes) was applied to all of the patients. Also patients were given an exercise program including range of motion, stretching and progressive resistive exercises. The therapy program was applied 5 times a week for 14 sessions. Pain severity was assessed by using visual analogue scale. Range of motion was measured by goniometer. Disability was evaluated by using Shoulder Pain and Disability Index.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: In group I, statistically significant improvements in pain severity, range of motion except internal and external rotation and SPADI scores were observed compared to baseline scores after the therapy (p<0.05). In Group II, all parameters except range of motion of external rotation were improved (p<0.05). However, no significant differences were recorded between the groups (p>0.05).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:: The Low level laser therapy seems to have no superiority over placebo laser therapy in reducing pain severity, range of motion and functional disability.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"5 joule/cm2 at each point over maximum 5‐6 painful points for 1 minute\", \"placebo laser therapy\", \"pain severity\", \"significantly decreased\", \"In group I, statistically significant improvements in pain severity, range of motion except internal and external rotation and SPADI scores were observed compared to baseline scores after the therapy (p<0.05).

Twenty‐nine children 2 to 6 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis of ASD participated in this randomized, blinded, placebo‐controlled, crossover trial. Participants were randomized to receive AUCB or placebo, evaluated at baseline, 12, and 24 weeks, received the opposite infusion, then re‐evaluated at the same time points. Evaluations included assessments of safety, Expressive One Word Picture Vocabulary Test, 4th edition, Receptive One Word Picture Vocabulary Test, 4th edition, Clinical Global Impression, Stanford‐Binet Fluid Reasoning and Knowledge, and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior and Socialization Subscales. Generalized linear models were used to assess the effects of the response variables at the 12‐ and 24‐week time periods under each condition (AUCB, placebo). There were no serious adverse events. There were trends toward improvement, particularly in socialization, but there were no statistically significant differences for any endpoints. The results of this study suggest that autologous umbilical cord infusions are safe for children with ASD. Tightly controlled trials are necessary to further progress the study of AUCB for autism. stem\ncells\ntranslational\nmedicine\n2018;7:333–341\n\n\nFindings:\n[[\"AUCB\", \"Placebo\", \"Stanford Binet\\ufffdKnowledge\", \"no significant difference\", \"There were no statistically significant changes in the EOWPVT (Fig. 3A), ROWPVT (Fig. 3B), or Stanford Binet subscales (Fig. 3C, 3D) when subjects received placebo versus AUCB at 12 and 24 weeks post infusion.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Patients were evaluated every 3 months and chemotherapy was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Overall response rate was the primary endpoint.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: 183 patients were included in the intent-to-treat analysis (92 TOMOX and 91 FOLFOX4). Overall response rate was 45.6 and 36.3 % (p = 0.003) for TOMOX and FOLFOX4, respectively. No statistically significant differences were observed in overall survival (15.6 and 17.2 months; p = 0.475); progression-free survival (7.7 and 8.7 months; p = 0.292), and response duration (6.4 and 7.6 months; p = 0.372) for TOMOX and FOLFOX4, respectively. Grades 3 and 4 neutropenia (p < 0.0001) and leukopenia (p = 0.028) were more common with the FOLFOX4 regimen, while hepatic disorders and asthenia were higher in TOMOX group (p = ns). There were two treatment-related deaths in the FOLFOX4 arm and one in the TOMOX arm. Quality of life analysis based on the SF-36 revealed differences between the two regimens for physical and mental composite scores after 6 weeks, and for body pain and emotional role functioning after 6 and 12 weeks; all of these favored the FOLFOX4 arm (p ≤ 0.05).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: TOMOX and FOLFOX4 seem to have similar efficacy and are well tolerated in the first-line treatment for advanced CRC with different profiles of toxicity.

This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study assessed the effects of RMD in the colonic transit time (CTT) and defecation characteristics (frequency, stool volume and consistency).\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Sixty-six healthy adult volunteers (32 men) who did not have a daily defecation habit had a 7-day run-in period before the 21-day intervention period with RMD or placebo. CTT and segmental CTT (SCTT) were assessed by a single abdominal X-ray film taken at the end of both periods after radiopaque marker ingestion. Defecation characteristics and intestinal functions were also assessed, which were self-reported by patients. Intragroup comparisons were evaluated by Student's paired t test, Bonferroni test and Chi-square test, while time comparisons by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and time-by-treatment interaction by repeated-measures ANOVA.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Fifty-seven subjects were assessed for CTT (placebo, n = 28; RMD, n = 29). In the RMD group, the total CTT, left SCTT and rectosigmoidal SCTT decreased significantly compared to baseline (p < 0.01 each; −13.3, −4.7, −8.7 h, respectively). Significant differences between groups were observed in total CTT and left SCTT. Significant time-by-treatment interaction was observed in the RMD group for stool volume (p = 0.014), increasing 56 % compared to baseline (p < 0.01), while remained unchanged in the placebo group. Stool consistency was improved only in the RMD group (p < 0.01). No adverse effects related to study products were observed.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: The results show that RMD improved CTT, stool volume, stool consistency and some intestinal functions in a healthy population.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Digestion-resistant maltodextrin\", \"Placebo\", \"Adverse events\", \"no significant difference\", \"No adverse effects related to study products were observed.\"], [\"Digestion-resistant maltodextrin\", \"Placebo\", \"Improvement in faeces consistency \", \"significantly increased\", \"Stool consistency was improved only in the RMD group (p \\u003c 0.01)\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Patients were evaluated every 3 months and chemotherapy was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Overall response rate was the primary endpoint.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: 183 patients were included in the intent-to-treat analysis (92 TOMOX and 91 FOLFOX4). Overall response rate was 45.6 and 36.3 % (p = 0.003) for TOMOX and FOLFOX4, respectively. No statistically significant differences were observed in overall survival (15.6 and 17.2 months; p = 0.475); progression-free survival (7.7 and 8.7 months; p = 0.292), and response duration (6.4 and 7.6 months; p = 0.372) for TOMOX and FOLFOX4, respectively. Grades 3 and 4 neutropenia (p < 0.0001) and leukopenia (p = 0.028) were more common with the FOLFOX4 regimen, while hepatic disorders and asthenia were higher in TOMOX group (p = ns). There were two treatment-related deaths in the FOLFOX4 arm and one in the TOMOX arm. Quality of life analysis based on the SF-36 revealed differences between the two regimens for physical and mental composite scores after 6 weeks, and for body pain and emotional role functioning after 6 and 12 weeks; all of these favored the FOLFOX4 arm (p ≤ 0.05).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: TOMOX and FOLFOX4 seem to have similar efficacy and are well tolerated in the first-line treatment for advanced CRC with different profiles of toxicity. The convenient TOMOX regimen may offer an alternative to fluoropyrimidine-based regimens.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"TOMOX\", \"FOLFOX4\", \"Overall response rate\", \"significantly increased\", \"Overall response rate was 45.6 and 36.3 % (p = 0.003) for TOMOX and FOLFOX4, respectively.\"],\n    [\"TOMOX\", \"FOLFOX4\", \"Overall survival\", \"no significant difference\", \"No statistically significant differences were observed in overall survival (15.6 and 17.2 months; p = 0.475) for TOMOX and FOLFOX4, respectively.\"],\n    [\"TOMOX\", \"FOLFOX4\", \"Progression-free survival\", \"no significant difference\", \"No statistically significant differences were observed in progression-free survival (7.7 and 8.7 months; p = 0.292) for TOMOX and FOLFOX4, respectively.\"],\n    [\"TOMOX\", \"FOLFOX4\", \"Response duration\", \"no significant difference\", \"No statistically significant differences were observed in response duration (6.4 and 7.6 months; p = 0.372) for TOMOX and FOLFOX4, respectively.\"],\n    [\"FOLFOX4\", \"TOMOX\", \"Grades 3 and 4 neutropenia\", \"significantly increased\", \"Grades 3 and 4 neutropenia (p < 0.0001) and leukopenia (p = 0.028) were more common with the FOLFOX4 regimen.\"],\n    [\"TOMOX\", \"FOLFOX4\", \"Quality of life\", \"significantly increased\", \"Quality of life analysis based on the SF-36 revealed differences between the two regimens for physical and mental composite scores after 6 weeks, and for body pain and emotional role functioning after 6 and 12 weeks; all of these favored the FOLFOX4 arm (p ≤ 0.05).\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"TOMOX\", \"FOLFOX4\", \"Overall response rate\", \"significantly increased\", \"Overall response rate was 45.6 and 36.3 % (p = 0.003) for TOMOX and FOLFOX4, respectively.\"],\n    [\"TOMOX\", \"FOLFOX4\", \"Overall survival\", \"no significant difference\", \"No statistically significant differences were observed in overall survival (15.6 and 17.2 months; p = 0.475) for TOMOX and FOLFOX4, respectively.\"],\n    [\"TOMOX\", \"FOLFOX4\", \"Progression-free survival\", \"no significant difference\", \"No statistically significant differences were observed in progression-free survival (7.7 and 8.7 months; p = 0.292) for TOMOX and FOLFOX4, respectively.\"],\n    [\"TOMOX\", \"FOLFOX4\", \"Response duration\", \"no significant difference\", \"No statistically significant differences were observed in response duration (6.4 and 7.6 months; p = 0.372) for TOMOX and FOLFOX4, respectively.\"],\n    [\"FOLFOX4\", \"TOMOX\", \"Grades 3 and 4 neutropenia\", \"significantly increased\", \"Grades 3 and 4 neutropenia (p < 0.0001) and leukopenia (p = 0.028) were more common with the FOLFOX4 regimen.\"],\n    [\"TOMOX\", \"FOLFOX4\", \"Quality of life\", \"significantly increased\", \"Quality of life analysis based on the SF-36 revealed differences between the two regimens for physical and mental composite scores after 6 weeks, and for body pain and emotional role functioning after 6 and 12 weeks; all of these favored the FOLFOX4 arm (p ≤ 0.05).\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "aa3b985bf199bdd55ea1d450ce7084c678b8beddadad7a71186f2193e7c99e5c", "prompt_hash": "53f4482823fa8eb373f98d0ec4a7b3030b9ae6951d0519df10909235245e83c0", "target_hash": "7432f77e9a3c49cd3ef4c26c7fc500e45985885a1560abd96abfcc284f53aedd", "bypass": null}

We developed a highly-structured manualized eight-session cognitive-behavioral program with a focus on subthreshold depression in the workplace and to be administered via telephone by trained psychotherapists (tCBT).\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: We conducted a parallel-group, non-blinded randomized controlled trial of tCBT in addition to the pre-existing Employee Assistance Program (EAP) versus EAP alone among workers with subthreshold depression at a large manufacturing company in Japan. The primary outcomes were depression severity as measured with Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and presenteeism as measured with World Health Organization Health and Work Productivity Questionnaire (HPQ). In the course of the trial the follow-up period was shortened in order to increase acceptability of the study.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The planned sample size was 108 per arm but the trial was stopped early due to low accrual. Altogether 118 subjects were randomized to tCBT+EAP (n = 58) and to EAP alone (n = 60). The BDI-II scores fell from the mean of 17.3 at baseline to 11.0 in the intervention group and to 15.7 in the control group after 4 months (p<0.001, Effect size = 0.69, 95%CI: 0.32 to 1.05).

Each fat had melting characteristics, plasticity and solids fat content suitable for use as hardstock in margarine and other solid fat formulations.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Thirty human volunteers were fed complete, whole food diets during 4 wk periods, where total fat (~31% daily energy, >70% from the test fats) and fatty acid composition were tightly controlled. A crossover design was used with 3 randomly-assigned diet rotations and repeated-measures analysis. One test fat rotation was based on palm olein (POL) and provided 12.0 percent of energy (%en) as palmitic acid (16:0); a second contained trans-rich partially hydrogenated soybean oil (PHSO) and provided 3.2 %en as trans fatty acids plus 6.5 %en as 16:0, while the third used an interesterified fat (IE) and provided 12.5 %en as stearic acid (18:0). After 4 wk the plasma lipoproteins, fatty acid profile, as well as fasting glucose and insulin were assessed. In addition, after 2 wk into each period an 8 h postprandial challenge was initiated in a subset of 19 subjects who consumed a meal containing 53 g of test fat.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: After 4 wk, both PHSO and IE fats significantly elevated both the LDL/HDL ratio and fasting blood glucose, the latter almost 20% in the IE group relative to POL. Fasting 4 wk insulin was 10% lower after PHSO (p > 0.05) and 22% lower after IE (p < 0.001) compared to POL. For the postprandial study the glucose incremental area under the curve (IAUC) following the IE meal was 40% greater than after either other meal (p < 0.001), and was linked to relatively depressed insulin and C-peptide (p < 0.05).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Both PHSO and IE fats altered the metabolism of lipoproteins and glucose relative to an unmodified saturated fat when fed to humans under identical circumstances.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"partially hydrogenated soybean oil (PHSO) , interesterified fat (IE)\", \"palm olein (POL)\", \"LDL/HDL ratio and fasting blood glucose\", \"significantly increased\", \"After 4 wk, both PHSO and IE fats significantly elevated both the LDL/HDL ratio and fasting blood glucose, the latter almost 20% in the IE group relative to POL.\"], [\"partially hydrogenated soybean oil (PHSO) , interesterified fat (IE)\", \"palm olein (POL)\", \"insulin\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Fasting 4 wk insulin was 10% lower after PHSO (p \\u0026gt; 0.05) and 22% lower after IE (p \\u0026lt; 0.001) compared to POL.\"], [\"partially hydrogenated soybean oil (PHSO) , interesterified fat (IE)\", \"palm olein (POL)\", \"insulin\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Fasting 4 wk insulin was 10% lower after PHSO (p \\u003e 0.05) and 22% lower after IE (p \\u003c 0.001) compared to POL\"], [\" interesterified fat (IE)\", \"palm olein (POL), partially hydrogenated soybean oil (PHSO) ,\", \"postprandial study the glucose incremental area\", \"significantly increased\", \"For the postprandial study the glucose incremental area under the curve (IAUC) following the IE meal was 40% greater than after either other meal (p \\u0026lt; 0.001),\"], [\" interesterified fat (IE)\", \"palm olein (POL), partially hydrogenated soybean oil (PHSO) ,\", \"postprandial study the glucose incremental area\", \"significantly increased\", \"For the postprandial study the glucose incremental area under the curve (IAUC) following the IE meal was 40% greater than after either other meal (p \\u003c 0.001),\"], [\" interesterified fat (IE)\", \"palm olein (POL), partially hydrogenated soybean oil (PHSO) ,\", \"insulin and C-peptide\", \"significantly decreased\", \"For the postprandial study the glucose incremental area under the curve (IAUC) following the IE meal was 40% greater than after either other meal (p \\u0026lt; 0.001), and was linked to relatively depressed insulin and C-peptide (p \\u0026lt; 0.05).\"], [\" interesterified fat (IE)\", \"palm olein (POL), partially hydrogenated soybean oil (PHSO) ,\", \"insulin and C-peptide\", \"significantly decreased\", \"For the postprandial study the glucose incremental area under the curve (IAUC) following the IE meal was 40% greater than after either other meal (p \\u003c 0.001), and was linked to relatively depressed insulin and C-peptide (p \\u003c 0.05).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

We developed a highly-structured manualized eight-session cognitive-behavioral program with a focus on subthreshold depression in the workplace and to be administered via telephone by trained psychotherapists (tCBT).\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: We conducted a parallel-group, non-blinded randomized controlled trial of tCBT in addition to the pre-existing Employee Assistance Program (EAP) versus EAP alone among workers with subthreshold depression at a large manufacturing company in Japan. The primary outcomes were depression severity as measured with Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and presenteeism as measured with World Health Organization Health and Work Productivity Questionnaire (HPQ). In the course of the trial the follow-up period was shortened in order to increase acceptability of the study.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The planned sample size was 108 per arm but the trial was stopped early due to low accrual. Altogether 118 subjects were randomized to tCBT+EAP (n = 58) and to EAP alone (n = 60). The BDI-II scores fell from the mean of 17.3 at baseline to 11.0 in the intervention group and to 15.7 in the control group after 4 months (p<0.001, Effect size = 0.69, 95%CI: 0.32 to 1.05). However, there was no statistically significant decrease in absolute and relative presenteeism (p = 0.44, ES = 0.15, −0.21 to 0.52, and p = 0.50, ES = 0.02, −0.34 to 0.39, respectively).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Remote CBT, including tCBT, may provide easy access to quality-assured effective psychotherapy for people in the work force who present with subthreshold depression.

This double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessed the ability of MPS to promote terminal hair growth in adult women with self-perceived thinning hair associated with poor diet, stress, hormonal influences, or abnormal menstrual cycles. Adult women with thinning hair were randomized to receive MPS (N = 30) or placebo (N = 30) twice daily for 90 days. Digital images were obtained from a 4 cm2 area scalp target area. Each subject's hair was washed and shed hairs were collected and counted. After 90 days, these measures were repeated and subjects completed Quality of Life and Self-Assessment Questionnaires. MPS-treated subjects achieved a significant increase in the number of terminal hairs within the target area (P < 0.0001) which was significantly greater than placebo (P < 0.0001). MPS use also resulted in significantly less hair shedding (P = 0.002) and higher total Self-Assessment (P = 0.006) and Quality of Life Questionnaires scores (P = 0.035).

Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of nurse-led telephone follow-up on the level of adherence to dietary and medication regimen among patients after Myocardial Infarction (MI).\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS:: This non-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted on 100 elderly patients with MI who had referred to the cardiovascular clinics in Shiraz. Participants were selected and randomly assigned to intervention and control groups using balanced block randomization method. The intervention group received a nurse-led telephone follow-up. The data were collected using a demographic questionnaire, Morisky's 8-item medication adherence questionnaire, and dietary adherence questionnaire before and three months after the intervention. Data analysis was done by the SPSS statistical software (version 21), using paired t-test for intra-group and Chi-square and t-test for between groups comparisons. Significance level was set at<0.05.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: The results of Chi-square test showed no statistically significant difference between the intervention and control groups with respect to their adherence to dietary and medication regimen before the intervention (P>0.05).

A recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated the efficacy of alvimopan in reducing postoperative ileus and length of stay in cystectomy; however, a major limitation was the exclusion of epidural analgesia.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty–six cystectomy and urinary diversion procedures performed by seven surgeons were analyzed between January 2008 and April 2012. The first 50 patients did not receive alvimopan perioperatively, while the subsequent 36 received a single dose of 12 mg preoperatively and then 12 mg every 12 hours for 15 doses or until discharge.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The groups were equal with respect to age, gender, indication, surgeon, and type of diversion. Patients who received alvimopan experienced a shorter length of stay (LOS) versus those in who did not receive alvimopan (10.5 vs. 8.6 days, p = 0.005, 95% CI 0.6–3.3). Readmission for ileus was low in both alvimopan and control groups (0% and 4.4%, respectively). Costs were significantly lower in the alvimopan group than the control groups (2012 USD 32,443 vs. 40,604 p <0.001). This difference stood up to multivariate analysis with a $7,062 difference in hospital stay.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Use of alvimopan in the routine perioperative care of our cystectomy and urinary diversion patients has decreased LOS by 1.9 days. Additionally, institution of routine perioperative alvimopan has reduced costs by $7,062 per admission (20% reduction).

The primary outcome was baseline-to-endpoint change in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score. Secondary outcome measures included the Clinical Global Impressions-Bipolar Version Severity of Illness Scale (CGI-BP), the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) total score, the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score, and rates of response (≥50% baseline-to-endpoint reduction in MADRS total score), recovery, and remission.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Of the 156 Japanese patients, 104 had been allocated to olanzapine and 52 to placebo. All results are baseline-to-endpoint change. Compared to placebo, patients in the olanzapine group experienced greater improvement in the primary outcome measure, MADRS total score (−14.9 vs. −10.7; p = .01). They also had greater reductions in the following secondary measures: CGI- BP Depression (−1.41 vs. -0.89; p = .008), CGI-BP Bipolar (−1.31 vs. −0.83; p = .01), HAMD-17 (−11.7 vs. −7.9; p < .01), and YMRS (-0.32 vs. 0.34; p = .03). Differences in rates of response, recovery, and remission were not statistically significant. A greater proportion of olanzapine-treated patients reported treatment- emergent adverse events (87.5% vs. 59.6%; p < .001). Patients treated with olanzapine had greater increases in weight (p < .001) and fasting total cholesterol (p = .008); fasting triglycerides (p = .02), and fasting low-density lipoprotein (p = .01). There was a greater reduction in fasting high-density lipoprotein in olanzapine-treated patients (p = .01). Compared with placebo-group patients, more olanzapine-group patients shifted from borderline to high cholesterol (25.0% vs. 0.0%; p = .007) and had clinically significant weight gain (≥7% body weight) (20.2% vs. 1.9%; p = .001).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Results of this analysis support the efficacy and tolerability of olanzapine for the treatment of bipolar depression in Japanese patients. Results in this population were consistent with those seen in the more ethnically diverse parent study. In making treatment decisions for individual patients, clinicians should carefully consider the risks and benefits of olanzapine treatment.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicatrials.gov ID NCT00510146 Olanzapine Treatment of Patients with Bipolar I Disorder\n\nFindings:\n[[\"olanzapine\", \"placebo\", \"improvement in the primary outcome measure, MADRS total score\", \"significantly increased\", \"Compared to placebo, patients in the olanzapine group experienced greater improvement in the primary outcome measure, MADRS total score (\\u221214.9 vs. \\u221210.7; p\\u2009=\\u2009.01).\"], [\"olanzapine\", \"placebo\", \"reductions in the following secondary measures: CGI- BP Depression\", \"significantly increased\", \"They also had greater reductions in the following secondary measures: CGI- BP Depression (\\u22121.41 vs. -0.89; p\\u2009=\\u2009.008),\"], [\"olanzapine\", \"placebo\", \"rates of response, recovery, and remission\", \"no significant difference\", \"Differences in rates of response, recovery, and remission were not statistically significant.\"], [\"olanzapine\", \"placebo\", \"treatment- emergent adverse events\", \"significantly increased\", \"A greater proportion of olanzapine-treated patients reported treatment- emergent adverse events (87.5% vs. 59.6%; p\\u2009\\u0026lt;\\u2009.001).\"], [\"olanzapine\", \"placebo\", \"treatment- emergent adverse events\", \"significantly increased\", \"A greater proportion of olanzapine-treated patients reported treatment- emergent adverse events (87.5% vs. 59.6%; p\\u2009\\u003c\\u2009.001).

Increased maternal self-efficacy can be an important step to reduce percentage of cesarean. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of training-based strategies to increase the self-efficacy for choosing delivery method among pregnant women in Shahrekord city.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS:: This quasi-experimental study was conducted on 130 pregnant women who attended urban health centers in Shahrekord city in 2013. Intervention was applied in the experimental group in three sessions in about 60-90 min while control group did not receive any intervention. Fear of childbirth and self-efficacy questionnaire was completed before and after training.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: While mean scores of the fear of childbirth, expectations and childbirth self-efficacy before the intervention between the two groups were not significantly different (P > 0.05), mean scores of childbirth in intervention group was reduced and expectation and childbirth self-efficacy had a significant increase after intervention (P < 0.05). In this study, 71.4% of mothers in intervention group and 53.8% of control mothers naturally delivered their children. Most of intervention group mothers desired to deliver through cesarean and had more fear (P < 0.001) but lower childbirth expectation (P > 0.05) and self-efficacy (P < 0.001) than those who chose normal method.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:: Our findings showed that training-based self-efficacy procedure has been effective in encouraging mothers to choose natural childbirth.

A demographic checklist and a standard questionnaire covering health-promoting lifestyle, health-related QoL, self-efficacy, perceived affect, perceived social support, and perceived barriers dimensions were used to gather required data. Independent-samples t test, paired-samples t-test, and ANCOVA were used to analyze the data.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: Analysis of covariance showed that after adjusting for effects of pretest scores, the difference between mean post-test scores of health-promoting lifestyle scale, health-related QoL scale, and all constructs of Pender's health promotion model (self-efficacy, perceived affect, perceived social support, and perceived barriers) in the intervention group 1 and control group were significant (P< 0.0001). In addition, changes in mean scores of lifestyle scale (42.4 ± 13.6), QoL scale (29.1 ± 14.2), self-efficacy (16.1 ± 2.6), perceived affect (16.1 ± 8), social support (35.4 ± 12.4), and barriers (17.2 ± 15.8) before and after intervention were significant in the intervention group 2 (P < 0.0001).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:: Application of family-centered empowerment model among methamphetamine users and their families is practically feasible and can result in enhancement and improvement of their QoL, lifestyle, and health promotion model constructs.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"a group for training of methamphetamine users who were in recovery phase (intervention group 1) and control\", \"baseline\", \"mean post-test scores of health-promoting lifestyle scale, health-related QoL scale, and all constructs of Pender\\u0027s health promotion model (self-efficacy, perceived affect, perceived social support, and perceived barriers)\", \"significantly increased\", \"Analysis of covariance showed that after adjusting for effects of pretest scores, the difference between mean post-test scores of health-promoting lifestyle scale, health-related QoL scale, and all constructs of Pender\\u0027s health promotion model (self-efficacy, perceived affect, perceived social support, and perceived barriers) in the intervention group 1 and control group were significant (P\\u003c 0.0001).

The present studies aimed to demonstrate the added benefit and optimal dosages of the combination product over individual ingredients alone in improving sleep and pain.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Each of the two studies was a two-centre, randomised, double-blind and double-dummy trial. In the first study, subjects were randomised into one of the following treatment arms: NS 440 mg/DPH 50 mg, NS 220 mg/DPH 50 mg, NS 440 mg or DPH 50 mg. In the second study, subjects received either NS 440 mg/DPH 25 mg, NS 440 mg or DPH 50 mg. The co-primary end-points in both studies were wake time after sleep onset (WASO) and sleep latency (SL) measured by actigraphy. Other secondary sleep and pain end-points were also assessed.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The intent-to-treat population included 712 and 267 subjects from studies one and two, respectively. In the first study, only the NS 440 mg/DPH 50 mg combination showed significant improvements in both WASO vs. NS alone (−70.3 min p = 0.0002) and SL vs. DPH alone (25.50 and 41.50 min respectively, p < 0.0001). In the second study, the NS 440 mg/DPH 25 mg combination failed to show any significant improvements vs. either component alone.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Only the NS 440 mg/DPH 50 mg combination demonstrated improvement in both sleep latency vs. DPH 50 mg and sleep maintenance (WASO) vs. NS 440 mg.

Triphala mouthwash is used in the treatment of periodontal diseases because of its antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of triphala mouthwash with 0.2% chlorhexidine in hospitalized periodontal disease patients.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized, multicenter clinical trial, 120 patients were equally divided into three groups. Patients in group A were advised to rinse their mouths with 10 mL of distilled water, group B with 0.2% chlorhexidine, and group C with triphala mouthwash for 1 minute twice daily for two weeks. The plaque index (PI) and the gingival index (GI) were recorded on the first and the fifteenth day.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: There was no significant difference when the efficacy of triphala was compared with 0.2% chlorhexidine in hospitalized patients with periodontal disease. However, a statistically significant difference was observed in PI and GI when both group B and group C were compared with group A and also within groups B and C, after 15 days (P<0.05).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: The triphala mouthwash (herbal) is an effective antiplaque agent like 0.2% chlorhexidine.

We evaluated the effects of ESWT on plantar fasciitis in terms of ultrasonographic and subjective evaluations.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:: In this randomized placebo-controlled trial, patients with plantar fasciitis were assigned to receive ESWT (4000 shock waves/session of 0.2 mJ/mm2) in 3 sessions at weekly intervals) or sham therapy (n = 20 in each group). Outcomes were documented by the ultrasonographic appearance of the aponeurosis and by patients' pain scores, performed at baseline and 12 weeks after completion of the therapy.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: The two groups were similar in baseline characteristics. Over the study period, plantar fascia thickness significantly reduced in the ESWT group (4.1 ± 1.3 to 3.6 ± 1.2 mm, P < 0.001), but slightly increased in the sham group (4.1 ± 0.8 to 4.5 ± 0.9 mm, P = 0.03). Both groups showed significant pain improvement over the course of the study (P < 0.001), though pain scores were significantly more reduced in the ESWT than the sham group (-4.2 ± 2.9 vs. -2.7 ± 1.8, P = 0.049).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:: Extracorporeal shock wave therapy contributes to healing and pain reduction in plantar fasciitis and ultrasound imaging is able to depict the morphologic changes related to plantar fasciitis as a result of this therapy.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Extracorporeal shock wave therapy\", \"Control\", \"Plantar fascia thickness\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Over the study period, plantar fascia thickness significantly reduced in the ESWT group (4.1 \\u00b1 1.3 to 3.6 \\u00b1 1.2 mm, P \\u003c 0.001), but slightly increased in the sham group (4.1 \\u00b1 0.8 to 4.5 \\u00b1 0.9 mm, P = 0.03).\"], [\"Extracorporeal shock wave therapy\", \"Control\", \"Pain \", \"significantly decreased\", \"Both groups showed significant pain improvement over the course of the study (P \\u003c 0.001), though pain scores were significantly more reduced in the ESWT than the sham group (-4.2 \\u00b1 2.9 vs. -2.7 \\u00b1 1.8, P = 0.049).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

To evaluate the efficacy of epoetin-α prior to revision total knee arthroplasty, we hypothesized that epoetin-α will reduce blood transfusion. Methods. Eighty-one patients were compared in this retrospective review; twenty-eight patients received our dosing regimen. All patients were mildly anemic. Epoetin-α to control (1 : 2) patient matching occurred so that one of two attending surgeons, gender, BMI, complexity of surgery, ASA score, and age were similar between groups. The clinical triggers for blood transfusion during or after the procedure were determined based on peri- and postoperative hemoglobin levels, ASA score, and/or clinical symptoms consistent with anemia. Blood salvage was not used. Results. Blood transfusion and length of stay were lower in the study group. None of the patients who received epoetin-α underwent transfusion. Hemoglobin increased from 11.97 to 13.8, preoperatively. Hemoglobin at day of surgery and time of discharge were higher. Gender, BMI, ASA score, total and hidden blood losses, calculated blood loss, preop PLT, PT, PTT, and INR were similar between groups. One Epogen patient had an uncomplicated DVT (3.6%). Conclusions. Epoetin-α may have a role in the mildly anemic revision knee patient.

GDM patients were randomised to 2 groups per target glycaemic levels: GDM1 (tight glycaemic targets, fasting blood glucose < 5.1 mmol/L and <7.0 mmol/L postprandial, N = 20) and GDM2 (less tight glycaemic targets, <5.3 mmol/L and < 7.8 mmol/L, respectively, N = 21). The control group included 25 women with normal glucose tolerance. ANGPTL4 expression was decreased in the HUVECs from GDM patients versus the control group (23.11 ± 5.71, 21.47 ± 5.64, and 98.33 ± 20.92, for GDM1, GDM2, and controls; p < 0.001) with no difference between GDM1 and GDM2. The level of adiponectin gene expression was low and did not differ among the groups. Leptin gene expression was undetectable in HUVECs. In cord blood, leptin/adiponectin ratio (LAR) was increased in GDM2 compared to controls and GDM1 (p = 0.038) and did not differ between GDM1 and controls. Tight glycaemic targets were associated with normalisation of increased LAR in the cord blood.

GDM patients were randomised to 2 groups per target glycaemic levels: GDM1 (tight glycaemic targets, fasting blood glucose < 5.1 mmol/L and <7.0 mmol/L postprandial, N = 20) and GDM2 (less tight glycaemic targets, <5.3 mmol/L and < 7.8 mmol/L, respectively, N = 21). The control group included 25 women with normal glucose tolerance. ANGPTL4 expression was decreased in the HUVECs from GDM patients versus the control group (23.11 ± 5.71, 21.47 ± 5.64, and 98.33 ± 20.92, for GDM1, GDM2, and controls; p < 0.001) with no difference between GDM1 and GDM2. The level of adiponectin gene expression was low and did not differ among the groups. Leptin gene expression was undetectable in HUVECs. In cord blood, leptin/adiponectin ratio (LAR) was increased in GDM2 compared to controls and GDM1 (p = 0.038) and did not differ between GDM1 and controls. Tight glycaemic targets were associated with normalisation of increased LAR in the cord blood.

The aim of this case-controlled study was to investigate if vitamin D supplementation could improve pain management, quality of life (QoL) and decrease infections in palliative cancer patients.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Thirty-nine palliative cancer patients with levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 75 nmol/L were supplemented with vitamin D 4000 IE/day, and were compared to 39 untreated, matched \"control\"-patients from a previous study at the same ward. Opioid doses, antibiotic consumption and QoL-scores measured with the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) were monitored. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline after 1 and 3 months compared between the groups using linear regression with adjustment for a potential cofounding factor.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: After 1 month the vitamin D treated group had a significantly decreased fentanyl dose compared to the untreated group with a difference of 46 μg/h; 95% CI 24–78, which increased further at 3 months to 91 μg/h; 95% CI 56–140 μg/h. The ESAS QoL-score improved in the Vitamin D group the first month; -1.4; 95% CI -2.6 - (-0.21). The vitamin D-treated group had significantly lower consumption of antibiotics after 3 months compared to the untreated group, the difference was -26%; 95%CI -0.41%–(-0.12%). Vitamin D was well tolerated by all patients and no adverse events were reported.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Vitamin D supplementation to palliative cancer patients is safe and improvement in pain management is noted as early as 1 month after treatment. Decreased infections are noted 3 months after vitamin D treatment.

In a prospective, single-site, open-label, non-randomized, controlled, pilot trial, we evaluated a polyherbal formulation (PHF) for its safety and efficacy in treating subjects with HIV-AIDS.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS:: A total of 32 and 31 subjects were enrolled under the PHF and highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) arms, respectively, and followed up for a period of 24 months. Plasma viral RNA, CD4 cell count and blood chemistry were monitored at 3-month intervals. Following mid-term safety evaluation, 12 subjects from the PHF arm were shifted to HAART and were followed separately as PHF-to-HAART arm, for the rest of the period.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: The HAART arm was characterized by significant improvements in CD4 cell count (154.4 cells/μl/year, P<0.001) and reduction in plasma viral load within 3 to 6 months (-0.431+ 0.004 log10 IU/month, P<0.001). In contrast, the PHF arm showed a profile of CD4 cell loss at remarkably slower kinetics (14.3 cells/μl/year, P=0.021) and insignificant reduction in the viral load. The PHF and HAART arms did not differ significantly in the occurrence of AIDS-related illnesses over the study period of 24 months. In the PHF-to-HAART arm, the rates of CD4 count and reduction in viral load were significant and comparable to that of the HAART group. In the PHF arm, at 1 month, a significant increase in CD4 cell count and a concomitant decrease in viral load were seen.\n\nABSTRACT.INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS:: The PHF appears to have provided protection by delaying the kinetics of CD4 cell reduction. Given the several study limitations, drawing assertive inferences from the data is challenging.

Increased maternal self-efficacy can be an important step to reduce percentage of cesarean. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of training-based strategies to increase the self-efficacy for choosing delivery method among pregnant women in Shahrekord city.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS:: This quasi-experimental study was conducted on 130 pregnant women who attended urban health centers in Shahrekord city in 2013. Intervention was applied in the experimental group in three sessions in about 60-90 min while control group did not receive any intervention. Fear of childbirth and self-efficacy questionnaire was completed before and after training.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: While mean scores of the fear of childbirth, expectations and childbirth self-efficacy before the intervention between the two groups were not significantly different (P > 0.05), mean scores of childbirth in intervention group was reduced and expectation and childbirth self-efficacy had a significant increase after intervention (P < 0.05). In this study, 71.4% of mothers in intervention group and 53.8% of control mothers naturally delivered their children. Most of intervention group mothers desired to deliver through cesarean and had more fear (P < 0.001) but lower childbirth expectation (P > 0.05) and self-efficacy (P < 0.001) than those who chose normal method.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:: Our findings showed that training-based self-efficacy procedure has been effective in encouraging mothers to choose natural childbirth. Therefore, the design and implementation of curriculum-based strategies for increasing self-efficacy is suggested for pregnant women.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Training-based strategies (experimental group)\", \"No intervention (control group)\", \"Means scores of expectations and childbirth self-efficacy\", \"significantly increased\", \"mean scores of childbirth in intervention group was reduced and expectation and childbirth self-efficacy had a significant increase after intervention (P \\u003c 0.05).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Here, a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study examined the effect of olanzapine (an atypical antipsychotic) augmentation therapy on sleep architecture, specifically slow wave sleep (SWS), in the treatment of depression. The effect of olanzapine augmentation therapy on other features of sleep (e.g., sleep continuity) and depression (e.g., illness severity and cognitive function) were also determined.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Patients currently experiencing a major depressive episode and who were on a stable medication were included. Sleep architecture was measured by overnight ambulatory polysomnography. Illness severity was determined using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Cognitive function was examined using Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB): Spatial Working Memory (SWM), Spatial Span (SSP), and Reaction Time (RTI) tasks. Polysomnographs, clinical measures and cognitive tests were administered at baseline, after 2–4 days of treatment and after 28–31 days of treatment. Twenty-five patients participated in the study (N = 10, N = 15 for placebo and olanzapine treated groups respectively).\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The primary objective of the study was to assess the objective (polysomnographic) changes in sleep quality, defined as changes in SWS, following olanzapine treatment for depression. Latency to but not duration of SWS was found to significantly differ between olanzapine- and placebo-treated participants (Hedge's g: 0.97, 0.13 respectively). A significant improvement in olanzapine-treated participants over placebo-treated participants was observed in secondary outcome measures, including sleep efficiency, total sleep time, and sleep latency. Secondary objectives assessed the subjective changes in sleep quality parameters and correlated them with measures of illness severity and changes in cognition. MADRS scores were significantly improved in olanzapine-treated participants over time but not more than placebo treatment. There was no significant difference between olanzapine- and placebo-treated participants in SWM, SSP or RTI tasks.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine augmentation treatment generally did not improve SWS but did improve sleep continuity and depression.

The patients ranged in age from 7 to 49 years, with myopia of -0.75 to -6.0 diopters (D) and astigmatism of 1.25 to 4.0 D. After excluding 21 subjects, 23 subjects (39 eyes) were analyzed after toric orthokeratology lens use. The subjects underwent ophthalmologic examination after 1 day and 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks of wearing overnight toric orthokeratology lenses.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: A total of 19 subjects (31 eyes) completed the trial after five subjects (eight eyes) dropped out. In the patients who completed the study by wearing lenses for 4 weeks, the myopic refractive error decreased significantly by 2.60 ± 2.21 D (p < 0.001), from -3.65 ± 1.62 to -1.05 ± 1.64 D. The astigmatic refractive error were also significantly decreased by 0.63 ± 0.98 D (p = 0.001), from 2.07 ± 0.83 to 1.44 ± 0.99 D. The mean uncorrected and corrected visual acuities before wearing the lenses were 2.14 ± 0.80 logarithm of the logMAR (logMAR) and 0.05 ± 0.13 logMAR, respectively, which changed to 0.12 ± 0.30 logarithm of the logMAR (p < 0.001) and 0.01 ± 0.04 logMAR (p = 0.156) after 4 weeks.

This analysis examined pooled efficacy data as reflected in cumulative pain scores from 10 randomized, double-blind liposome bupivacaine clinical studies in which the study drug was administered via local wound infiltration.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: A total of 823 patients were exposed to liposome bupivacaine in 10 local wound infiltration studies at doses ranging from 66 mg to 532 mg in five surgical settings; 446 patients received bupivacaine HCl (dose: 75–200 mg) and 190 received placebo. Efficacy measures were assessed through 72 hours after surgery.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Overall, 45% of patients were male and 19% were ≥65 years of age. In the analysis of cumulative pain intensity scores through 72 hours, liposome bupivacaine was associated with lower pain scores than the comparator in 16 of 19 treatment arms assessed, achieving statistically significant differences compared with bupivacaine HCl (P < 0.05) in five of 17 treatment arms. These results were supported by results of other efficacy measures, including time to first use of opioid rescue medication, proportion of patients avoiding opioid rescue medication, total postsurgical consumption of opioid rescue medication, and patient/care provider satisfaction with postoperative analgesia. Local infiltration of liposome bupivacaine resulted in significant systemic plasma levels of bupivacaine, which could persist for 96 hours; systemic plasma levels of bupivacaine following administration of liposome bupivacaine were not correlated with local efficacy. Liposome bupivacaine and bupivacaine HCl were generally well tolerated.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Based on this integrated analysis of multiple efficacy measures, liposome bupivacaine appears to be a potentially useful therapeutic option for prolonged reduction of postsurgical pain in soft tissue and orthopedic surgeries.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"liposome bupivacaine\", \"bupivacaine HCl\", \"cumulative pain\", \"significantly decreased\", \"In the analysis of cumulative pain intensity scores through 72 hours, liposome bupivacaine was associated with lower pain scores than the comparator in 16 of 19 treatment arms assessed, achieving statistically significant differences compared with bupivacaine HCl (P \\u003c 0.05) in five of 17 treatment arms\"], [\"liposome bupivacaine 266 mg \", \"placebo\", \"\\\"satisfied\\ufffd or \\\"extremely satisfied\\ufffd with their postoperative analgesia at 24 hours after surgery\", \"significantly increased\", \"At 24 hours after surgery in this study, 95% of patients in the liposome bupivacaine 266 mg group were \\\"satisfied\\\" or \\\"extremely satisfied\\\" with their postoperative analgesia compared with 72% in the placebo group (P = 0.0007). \"], [\"liposome bupivacaine 266 mg \", \"placebo\", \"\\\"satisfied\\ufffd or \\\"extremely satisfied\\ufffd with their postoperative analgesia at 72 hours after surgery\", \"significantly increased\", \"At 24 hours after surgery in this study, 95% of patients in the liposome bupivacaine 266 mg group were \\\"satisfied\\\" or \\\"extremely satisfied\\\" with their postoperative analgesia compared with 72% in the placebo group (P = 0.0007).

We performed the following: an intensive individual intervention (III), an intensive group intervention (IGI) and a minimal intervention (MI). Included in the study were smokers who were prepared to quit smoking. Excluded from the study were individuals aged less than 18 years or with severe mental conditions or terminal illnesses. The outcome measure was continued abstinence at 12 months confirmed through CO-oximetry (CO). The analysis was based on intention to treat.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: In total, 287 smokers were recruited: 81 in the III, 111 in the IGI, and 95 in the MI. Continued abstinence at 12 months confirmed through CO was 7.4% in the III, 5.4% in the IGI, and 1% in the MI. No significant differences were noted between III and MI on the one hand, and between IGI and MI on the other [RR 7.04 (0.9-7.2) and RR 5.1 (0.6-41.9), respectively]. No differences were noted between IGI and III [RR 0.7 (0.2-2.2)]. In multivariate analysis, only overall visit length showed a statistically significant association with smoking cessation.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of intensive smoking interventions in this study was lower than expected.

These results were supported by results of other efficacy measures, including time to first use of opioid rescue medication, proportion of patients avoiding opioid rescue medication, total postsurgical consumption of opioid rescue medication, and patient/care provider satisfaction with postoperative analgesia. Local infiltration of liposome bupivacaine resulted in significant systemic plasma levels of bupivacaine, which could persist for 96 hours; systemic plasma levels of bupivacaine following administration of liposome bupivacaine were not correlated with local efficacy. Liposome bupivacaine and bupivacaine HCl were generally well tolerated.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Based on this integrated analysis of multiple efficacy measures, liposome bupivacaine appears to be a potentially useful therapeutic option for prolonged reduction of postsurgical pain in soft tissue and orthopedic surgeries.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"liposome bupivacaine\", \"bupivacaine HCl\", \"cumulative pain intensity scores\", \"significantly decreased\", \"liposome bupivacaine was associated with lower pain scores than the comparator in 16 of 19 treatment arms assessed, achieving statistically significant differences compared with bupivacaine HCl (P < 0.05) in five of 17 treatment arms.\"],\n    [\"liposome bupivacaine\", \"bupivacaine HCl\", \"time to first use of opioid rescue medication\", \"significantly decreased\", \"These results were supported by results of other efficacy measures, including time to first use of opioid rescue medication, proportion of patients avoiding opioid rescue medication, total postsurgical consumption of opioid rescue medication, and patient/care provider satisfaction with postoperative analgesia.\"],\n    [\"liposome bupivacaine\", \"bupivacaine HCl\", \"proportion of patients avoiding opioid rescue medication\", \"significantly increased\", \"These results were supported by results of other efficacy measures, including time to first use of opioid rescue medication, proportion of patients avoiding opioid rescue medication, total postsurgical consumption of opioid rescue medication, and patient/care provider satisfaction with postoperative analgesia.\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"liposome bupivacaine\", \"bupivacaine HCl\", \"cumulative pain intensity scores\", \"significantly decreased\", \"liposome bupivacaine was associated with lower pain scores than the comparator in 16 of 19 treatment arms assessed, achieving statistically significant differences compared with bupivacaine HCl (P < 0.05) in five of 17 treatment arms.\"],\n    [\"liposome bupivacaine\", \"bupivacaine HCl\", \"time to first use of opioid rescue medication\", \"significantly decreased\", \"These results were supported by results of other efficacy measures, including time to first use of opioid rescue medication, proportion of patients avoiding opioid rescue medication, total postsurgical consumption of opioid rescue medication, and patient/care provider satisfaction with postoperative analgesia.\"],\n    [\"liposome bupivacaine\", \"bupivacaine HCl\", \"proportion of patients avoiding opioid rescue medication\", \"significantly increased\", \"These results were supported by results of other efficacy measures, including time to first use of opioid rescue medication, proportion of patients avoiding opioid rescue medication, total postsurgical consumption of opioid rescue medication, and patient/care provider satisfaction with postoperative analgesia.\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "1b693ab9223cbc1b36ec24885462aef4c59049915ca85a55a1def90159b867d9", "prompt_hash": "3b883c93377654d5ca7278f8435bce81a8effc7a8d986a64daa6ae958afd5c0b", "target_hash": "86d4dfd7eb257db32c90a322353395a207601f86c5a50bfe17cdacb56495e82f", "bypass": null}

Increased maternal self-efficacy can be an important step to reduce percentage of cesarean. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of training-based strategies to increase the self-efficacy for choosing delivery method among pregnant women in Shahrekord city.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS:: This quasi-experimental study was conducted on 130 pregnant women who attended urban health centers in Shahrekord city in 2013. Intervention was applied in the experimental group in three sessions in about 60-90 min while control group did not receive any intervention. Fear of childbirth and self-efficacy questionnaire was completed before and after training.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: While mean scores of the fear of childbirth, expectations and childbirth self-efficacy before the intervention between the two groups were not significantly different (P > 0.05), mean scores of childbirth in intervention group was reduced and expectation and childbirth self-efficacy had a significant increase after intervention (P < 0.05). In this study, 71.4% of mothers in intervention group and 53.8% of control mothers naturally delivered their children. Most of intervention group mothers desired to deliver through cesarean and had more fear (P < 0.001) but lower childbirth expectation (P > 0.05) and self-efficacy (P < 0.001) than those who chose normal method.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:: Our findings showed that training-based self-efficacy procedure has been effective in encouraging mothers to choose natural childbirth. Therefore, the design and implementation of curriculum-based strategies for increasing self-efficacy is suggested for pregnant women.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Training-based strategies (experimental group)\", \"No intervention (control group)\", \"Means scores of expectations and childbirth self-efficacy\", \"significantly increased\", \"mean scores of childbirth in intervention group was reduced and expectation and childbirth self-efficacy had a significant increase after intervention (P \\u003c 0.05).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Increasing interest in the use of low-dose ketamine for postoperative analgesia has developed in part because of its NMDA-antagonistic properties, which may be important in attenuating central sensitization and opioid tolerance. Despite of many trial evaluations which have been done on the effect of low-dose ketamine in postoperative pain, the role of ketamine, as a component of perioperative analgesia, remains unclear. We evaluated the analgesic effect of low-dose ketamine during anesthesia induction in painful ophthalmic surgery.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:: After institutional approval and written informed consent, 88 patients undergoing retinal detachment, strabismus, and keratoplasty surgery aged 18-80 years old were randomly divided intoequal case and control groups. Anesthesia was induced with sodium thiopental, fentanyl, atracurium, and liducaine, and maintained with N2O, O2, and propofol. Ketamine 0.5 mg/kg was administered intravenously to patients in the case group during anesthetic induction. Mean blood pressure and pulse rate were listed in questionnaire every 5 minutes. The consumption of anesthetic, perioperative additional analgesic, extubation time, postoperative pain and nausea scores (based on Visual Analog Scale), vomiting frequency, and the recovery time were recorded.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: There were no differences in the recovery time (17.3 ± 3.4 in the case group vs. 16.3 ± 3 in the control group, P < 0.05), postoperative pain scores (5 ± 1 in the case group vs. 5.6 ± 2 in the control group, P < 0.05), the consumption of anesthetic (9376.9 ± 1245.8 in the case group vs. 9012.9 ± 1620 in the control group, P < 0.05), the analgesic requirements (1000 in the case group vs. 940.9 ± 135.6 in the control group, P < 0.05), and perioperative additional analgesic (63.4 ± 26.5 in the case group vs. 69.4 ± 25.6 in the control group, P < 0.05) between two groups. The extubation time in the case group (13.59 ± 4.83) was significantly shorter than in the control group (15.9 ± 3.6) (P = 0.01).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: This study demonstrates that a low dose administration of ketamine during anesthesia induction in retinal detachment, strabismus, and keratoplasty surgery improves the extubation time but have no effect on postoperative pain, nausea and vomiting, and perioperative additional analgesic requirements.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"Ketamine\", \"Control\", \"Recovery time\", \"no significant difference\", \"There were no differences in the recovery time (17.3 \\u00b1 3.4 in the case group vs. 16.3 \\u00b1 3 in the control group, P \\u003c 0.05),\"], [\"Ketamine\", \"Control\", \"Post-Surgical Pain\", \"no significant difference\", \"There were no differences in the recovery time (17.3 \\u00b1 3.4 in the case group vs. 16.3 \\u00b1 3 in the control group, P \\u003c 0.05), postoperative pain scores (5 \\u00b1 1 in the case group vs. 5.6 \\u00b1 2 in the control group, P \\u003c 0.05),\"], [\"Ketamine\", \"Control\", \"Anesthetic usage\", \"no significant difference\", \"There were no differences in the recovery time (17.3 \\u00b1 3.4 in the case group vs. 16.3 \\u00b1 3 in the control group, P \\u003c 0.05), postoperative pain scores (5 \\u00b1 1 in the case group vs. 5.6 \\u00b1 2 in the control group, P \\u003c 0.05), the consumption of anesthetic (9376.9 \\u00b1 1245.8 in the case group vs. 9012.9 \\u00b1 1620 in the control group, P \\u003c 0.05),\"], [\"Ketamine\", \"Control\", \"Usage of analgesics\", \"no significant difference\", \"the analgesic requirements (1000 in the case group vs. 940.9 \\u00b1 135.6 in the control group\"], [\"Ketamine\", \"Control\", \"Time for extubation \", \"significantly decreased\", \"The extubation time in the case group (13.59 \\u00b1 4.83) was significantly shorter than in the control group (15.9 \\u00b1 3.6) (P = 0.01).\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:63"}, "target": "[[\"Ketamine\", \"Control\", \"Recovery time\", \"no significant difference\", \"There were no differences in the recovery time (17.3 \\u00b1 3.4 in the case group vs. 16.3 \\u00b1 3 in the control group, P \\u003c 0.05),\"], [\"Ketamine\", \"Control\", \"Post-Surgical Pain\", \"no significant difference\", \"There were no differences in the recovery time (17.3 \\u00b1 3.4 in the case group vs. 16.3 \\u00b1 3 in the control group, P \\u003c 0.05), postoperative pain scores (5 \\u00b1 1 in the case group vs. 5.6 \\u00b1 2 in the control group, P \\u003c 0.05),\"], [\"Ketamine\", \"Control\", \"Anesthetic usage\", \"no significant difference\", \"There were no differences in the recovery time (17.3 \\u00b1 3.4 in the case group vs. 16.3 \\u00b1 3 in the control group, P \\u003c 0.05), postoperative pain scores (5 \\u00b1 1 in the case group vs. 5.6 \\u00b1 2 in the control group, P \\u003c 0.05), the consumption of anesthetic (9376.9 \\u00b1 1245.8 in the case group vs. 9012.9 \\u00b1 1620 in the control group, P \\u003c 0.05),\"], [\"Ketamine\", \"Control\", \"Usage of analgesics\", \"no significant difference\", \"the analgesic requirements (1000 in the case group vs. 940.9 \\u00b1 135.6 in the control group\"], [\"Ketamine\", \"Control\", \"Time for extubation \", \"significantly decreased\", \"The extubation time in the case group (13.59 \\u00b1 4.83) was significantly shorter than in the control group (15.9 \\u00b1 3.6) (P = 0.01).\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

Selected patients were allocated in three treatment groups randomly to receive oral NAC (600 mg/twice daily) plus NS (100 ml/hour) (Group A), oral AA (250 mg/twice daily) plus NS (100 ml/hour) (Group B) and NS (100 ml/hour) (Group C), respectively. The occurrence of CIN was evaluated based on serum Cr and GFR in three studied groups, before and after angiography procedure. The analysis of variance and paired t-test were used for data analysis by SPSS.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The serum Cr increased and GFR decreased significantly during the intervention in three groups (P < 0.010).

The consumption of anesthetic, perioperative additional analgesic, extubation time, postoperative pain and nausea scores (based on Visual Analog Scale), vomiting frequency, and the recovery time were recorded.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: There were no differences in the recovery time (17.3 ± 3.4 in the case group vs. 16.3 ± 3 in the control group, P < 0.05), postoperative pain scores (5 ± 1 in the case group vs. 5.6 ± 2 in the control group, P < 0.05), the consumption of anesthetic (9376.9 ± 1245.8 in the case group vs. 9012.9 ± 1620 in the control group, P < 0.05), the analgesic requirements (1000 in the case group vs. 940.9 ± 135.6 in the control group, P < 0.05), and perioperative additional analgesic (63.4 ± 26.5 in the case group vs. 69.4 ± 25.6 in the control group, P < 0.05) between two groups. The extubation time in the case group (13.59 ± 4.83) was significantly shorter than in the control group (15.9 ± 3.6) (P = 0.01).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: This study demonstrates that a low dose administration of ketamine during anesthesia induction in retinal detachment, strabismus, and keratoplasty surgery improves the extubation time but have no effect on postoperative pain, nausea and vomiting, and perioperative additional analgesic requirements.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"Ketamine 0.5 mg/kg\", \"No ketamine\", \"Extubation time\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The extubation time in the case group (13.59 ± 4.83) was significantly shorter than in the control group (15.9 ± 3.6) (P = 0.01).\"],\n    [\"Ketamine 0.5 mg/kg\", \"No ketamine\", \"Postoperative pain scores\", \"no significant difference\", \"There were no differences in the postoperative pain scores (5 ± 1 in the case group vs. 5.6 ± 2 in the control group, P < 0.05).\"],\n    [\"Ketamine 0.5 mg/kg\", \"No ketamine\", \"Nausea and vomiting\", \"no significant difference\", \"There were no differences in the postoperative pain scores (5 ± 1 in the case group vs. 5.6 ± 2 in the control group, P < 0.05).\"],\n    [\"Ketamine 0.5 mg/kg\", \"No ketamine\", \"Perioperative additional analgesic\", \"no significant difference\", \"The perioperative additional analgesic (63.4 ± 26.5 in the case group vs. 69.4 ± 25.6 in the control group, P < 0.05) between two groups was not significantly different.\"],\n    [\"Ketamine 0.5 mg/kg\", \"No ketamine\", \"Recovery time\", \"no significant difference\", \"There were no differences in the recovery time (17.3 ± 3.4 in the case group vs. 16.3 ± 3 in the control group, P < 0.05).\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"Ketamine 0.5 mg/kg\", \"No ketamine\", \"Extubation time\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The extubation time in the case group (13.59 ± 4.83) was significantly shorter than in the control group (15.9 ± 3.6) (P = 0.01).\"],\n    [\"Ketamine 0.5 mg/kg\", \"No ketamine\", \"Postoperative pain scores\", \"no significant difference\", \"There were no differences in the postoperative pain scores (5 ± 1 in the case group vs. 5.6 ± 2 in the control group, P < 0.05).\"],\n    [\"Ketamine 0.5 mg/kg\", \"No ketamine\", \"Nausea and vomiting\", \"no significant difference\", \"There were no differences in the postoperative pain scores (5 ± 1 in the case group vs. 5.6 ± 2 in the control group, P < 0.05).\"],\n    [\"Ketamine 0.5 mg/kg\", \"No ketamine\", \"Perioperative additional analgesic\", \"no significant difference\", \"The perioperative additional analgesic (63.4 ± 26.5 in the case group vs. 69.4 ± 25.6 in the control group, P < 0.05) between two groups was not significantly different.\"],\n    [\"Ketamine 0.5 mg/kg\", \"No ketamine\", \"Recovery time\", \"no significant difference\", \"There were no differences in the recovery time (17.3 ± 3.4 in the case group vs. 16.3 ± 3 in the control group, P < 0.05).\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "93fb0a051578ccdb1fb9c42a246434e290980519310dc4c029813d24a0f06759", "prompt_hash": "227d4b71442fb064661ecf1a94f0f03ad0833df0cfae3f4227c357f2855db89b", "target_hash": "731493d51147d3a7715a74ecd876491a2dcb906efcf9da6a4f3b93bc584ca735", "bypass": null}

The optimal framework to categorize clinical trials according to risk remains unclear, however. Switzerland is the first European country to adopt a risk-based categorization procedure in January 2014. We assessed how accurately and consistently clinical trials are categorized using two different approaches: an approach using criteria set forth in the new law (concept) or an intuitive approach (ad hoc).\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS:: This was a randomized controlled trial with a method-comparison study nested in each arm. We used clinical trial protocols from eight Swiss ethics committees approved between 2010 and 2011. Protocols were randomly assigned to be categorized in one of three risk categories using the concept or the ad hoc approach. Each protocol was independently categorized by the trial's sponsor, a group of experts and the approving ethics committee. The primary outcome was the difference in categorization agreement between the expert group and sponsors across arms. Linear weighted kappa was used to quantify agreements, with the difference between kappas being the primary effect measure.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: We included 142 of 231 protocols in the final analysis (concept = 78; ad hoc = 64).

On the other hand, the importance of participatory care and high effectiveness of self-management programs have been confirmed. This study was aimed to examine the effect of an educational intervention on self-efficacy, self-care behaviors and blood pressure (BP) of hypertensive obese or overweight women in the primary health-care setting in Isfahan, Iran.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was an educational intervention program. It was performed among 146 hypertensive women of 30-65 age range who referred to 6 health care centers of Isfahan that randomly assigned to a control and intervention groups. The interventional group participated in the 6 weekly sessions including exercises, weight control, medication adherence, and home self-monitoring based on goal setting, and promotion of self-efficacy. The control group received routine care from health-care center and any special intervention has been done for the control group. Output variables were analyzed after intervention, and 6-month follow-up.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: There are no significant differences between age, weight, body mass index and BP and biochemical variables except lipids as well as behavioral factors at the baseline. After 6 months intervention self-efficacy (< 0.001) and physical activity (< 0.001) improvement of in the intervention group was significantly different in comparison with the control group. After 6 months, there was a significant reduction in systolic (P < 0.001) and diastolic BP (P = 0.010) in the intervention group.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Participatory method of education could help us to convince patients to have better self-care to control disease. Furthermore, since adherence to the treatment of hypertensive patients in our society is low, organizing such courses can teach essential knowledge and skills to lifestyle change and prevention of complications. Performing these courses is recommended for other chronic disease patients in health-care centers to assess self-management programs on self-care behavior.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"6 weekly sessions including exercises, weight control, medication adherence, and home self-monitoring\", \"routine care from health-care center\", \"average of physical activity\", \"significantly increased\", \"After 6 months intervention self-efficacy (\\u003c 0.001) and physical activity (\\u003c 0.001) improvement of in the intervention group was significantly different in comparison with the control group.\"], [\"6 weekly sessions including exercises, weight control, medication adherence, and home self-monitoring\", \"routine care from health-care center\", \"systolic and diastolic BP\", \"significantly decreased\", \"After 6 months, there was a significant reduction in systolic (P \\u003c 0.001) and diastolic BP (P = 0.010) in the intervention group.\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:65"}, "target": "[[\"6 weekly sessions including exercises, weight control, medication adherence, and home self-monitoring\", \"routine care from health-care center\", \"average of physical activity\", \"significantly increased\", \"After 6 months intervention self-efficacy (\\u003c 0.001) and physical activity (\\u003c 0.001) improvement of in the intervention group was significantly different in comparison with the control group.\"], [\"6 weekly sessions including exercises, weight control, medication adherence, and home self-monitoring\", \"routine care from health-care center\", \"systolic and diastolic BP\", \"significantly decreased\", \"After 6 months, there was a significant reduction in systolic (P \\u003c 0.001) and diastolic BP (P = 0.010) in the intervention group.\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

The primary endpoint was the change in body weight from the baseline. Vital signs, fluid intake, and laboratory and urinary data were assessed to determine the pharmacological effects after administration of aquaretic and natriuretic drugs.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: A total of 56 patients were randomized to receive either tolvaptan (n = 28) or furosemide (n = 28). In the combination and conventional diuretic groups, the average decrease in body weight from the baseline was 3.21 ± 3.17 kg (P < 0.0001) and 1.75 ± 2.36 kg (P = 0.0006), respectively, when measured on the final dosing day.

The control group received routine care from health-care center and any special intervention has been done for the control group. Output variables were analyzed after intervention, and 6-month follow-up.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: There are no significant differences between age, weight, body mass index and BP and biochemical variables except lipids as well as behavioral factors at the baseline. After 6 months intervention self-efficacy (< 0.001) and physical activity (< 0.001) improvement of in the intervention group was significantly different in comparison with the control group. After 6 months, there was a significant reduction in systolic (P < 0.001) and diastolic BP (P = 0.010) in the intervention group.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Participatory method of education could help us to convince patients to have better self-care to control disease. Furthermore, since adherence to the treatment of hypertensive patients in our society is low, organizing such courses can teach essential knowledge and skills to lifestyle change and prevention of complications. Performing these courses is recommended for other chronic disease patients in health-care centers to assess self-management programs on self-care behavior.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[[\"educational intervention program\", \"routine care from health-care center\", \"self-efficacy\", \"significantly increased\", \"After 6 months intervention self-efficacy (< 0.001) and physical activity (< 0.001) improvement of in the intervention group was significantly different in comparison with the control group.\"], [\"educational intervention program\", \"routine care from health-care center\", \"blood pressure\", \"significantly decreased\", \"After 6 months, there was a significant reduction in systolic (P < 0.001) and diastolic BP (P = 0.010) in the intervention group.\"]]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[[\"educational intervention program\", \"routine care from health-care center\", \"self-efficacy\", \"significantly increased\", \"After 6 months intervention self-efficacy (< 0.001) and physical activity (< 0.001) improvement of in the intervention group was significantly different in comparison with the control group.\"], [\"educational intervention program\", \"routine care from health-care center\", \"blood pressure\", \"significantly decreased\", \"After 6 months, there was a significant reduction in systolic (P < 0.001) and diastolic BP (P = 0.010) in the intervention group.\"]]"], "doc_hash": "8de7e192db0719f802d2182244bbe559911f62e6ed967184c99a2f47b3e39fe3", "prompt_hash": "6ca7bd0a7b6c3562fbd78ea6016d2a1c26e0fc05008813946cd8c2d49e1feffc", "target_hash": "d94f84fa473618820fb0c591f1fcd77369353a167f2ee7177171fa4ba30691da", "bypass": null}

In each patient one ovary was randomly allocated to retrieval with either a 20 G/ 35 mm (thin) or 17 G/ 35 mm (standard) needle, the other ovary was then retrieved with the opposite needle.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The standard diameter needle was used to collect a total of 215 oocytes from 355 aspirated follicles (60.6%) compared to 203 oocytes from 352 aspirated follicles (57.7%) with the thinner needle (p = 0.23). Stratifying outcomes by anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), as indicator of ovarian reserve, and by body mass index (BMI) the oocyte yields, still, did not differ (AMH, r (17) = −0.20, p = 0.44; BMI, r (17) =0.02, p = 0.96). Outcomes also did not vary among women with diminished ovarian reserve (p = 0.17) and in women with normal ovarian reserve (p = 1.00). Operating time was, however, significantly increased by 3.3 minutes per ovary (z = −3.08, p = 0.002) with the thinner needle.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Needle diameter does not affect oocyte yield, including in obese patients and patients with diminished ovarian reserve.

This 12-week, double-blind study compared the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of indacaterol to that of placebo in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Efficacy variables included 24-h trough FEV1 (mean of 23 h 10 min and 23 h 45 min post-dose) at Week 12 (primary endpoint) and after Day 1, and the percentage of COPD days with poor control (i.e., worsening symptoms). Safety was assessed by adverse events (AEs), mean serum potassium and blood glucose, QTc (Fridericia), and vital signs.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Patients were randomised (n = 416, mean age 63 years) to receive either indacaterol 150 μg o.d. (n = 211) or placebo (n = 205) via a single-dose dry-powder inhaler; 87.5% completed the study. Trough FEV1 (LSM ± SEM) at Week 12 was 1.48 ± 0.018 L for indacaterol and 1.35 ± 0.019 L for placebo, a clinically relevant difference of 130 ± 24 mL (p < 0.001). Trough FEV1 after one dose was significantly higher with indacaterol than placebo (p < 0.001). Indacaterol demonstrated significantly higher peak FEV1 than placebo, both on Day 1 and at Week 12, with indacaterol-placebo differences (LSM ± SEM) of 190 ± 28 (p < 0.001) and 160 ± 28 mL (p < 0.001), respectively. Standardised AUC measurements for FEV1 (between 5 min and 4 h, 5 min and 1 h, and 1 and 4 h post-dose) at Week 12 were all significantly greater with indacaterol than placebo (p < 0.001), with LSM (± SEM) differences of 170 ± 24, 180 ± 24, and 170 ± 24 mL, respectively. Indacaterol significantly reduced the percentage of days of poor control versus placebo by 22.5% (p < 0.001) and was also associated with significantly reduced use of rescue medication (p < 0.001). The overall rates of AEs were comparable between the groups (indacaterol 49.3%, placebo 46.8%), with the most common AEs being COPD worsening (indacaterol 8.5%, placebo 12.2%) and cough (indacaterol 6.2%, placebo 7.3%). One patient died in the placebo group. Serum potassium and blood glucose levels did not differ significantly between the two groups, and no patient had QTc >500 ms.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Indacaterol 150 μg o.d. provided clinically significant and sustained bronchodilation, reduced rescue medication use, and had a safety and tolerability profile similar to placebo.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT00624286\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"indacaterol 150 \\u03bcg o.d\", \"placebo\", \"FEV1 after one dose\", \"significantly increased\", \"Trough FEV1 after one dose was significantly higher with indacaterol than placebo (p \\u003c 0.001).\"], [\"indacaterol 150 \\u03bcg o.d\", \"placebo\", \"Standardised AUC measurements for FEV1 at Week 12\", \"significantly increased\", \"Standardised AUC measurements for FEV1 (between 5 min and 4 h, 5 min and 1 h, and 1 and 4 h post-dose) at Week 12 were all significantly greater with indacaterol than placebo (p \\u003c 0.001), with LSM (\\u00b1 SEM) differences of 170 \\u00b1 24, 180 \\u00b1 24, and 170 \\u00b1 24 mL, respectively.\"], [\"indacaterol 150 \\u03bcg o.d\", \"placebo\", \"forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) at Week 12\", \"significantly increased\", \"Trough FEV1 (LSM \\u00b1 SEM) at Week 12 was 1.48 \\u00b1 0.018 L for indacaterol and 1.35 \\u00b1 0.019 L for placebo, a clinically relevant difference of 130 \\u00b1 24 mL (p \\u003c 0.001).\"], [\"indacaterol 150 \\u03bcg o.d\", \"placebo\", \"The overall rate of adverse events (ASs)\", \"no significant difference\", \"The overall rates of AEs were comparable between the groups (indacaterol 49.3%, placebo 46.8%)\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:67"}, "target": "[[\"indacaterol 150 \\u03bcg o.d\", \"placebo\", \"FEV1 after one dose\", \"significantly increased\", \"Trough FEV1 after one dose was significantly higher with indacaterol than placebo (p \\u003c 0.001).\"], [\"indacaterol 150 \\u03bcg o.d\", \"placebo\", \"Standardised AUC measurements for FEV1 at Week 12\", \"significantly increased\", \"Standardised AUC measurements for FEV1 (between 5 min and 4 h, 5 min and 1 h, and 1 and 4 h post-dose) at Week 12 were all significantly greater with indacaterol than placebo (p \\u003c 0.001), with LSM (\\u00b1 SEM) differences of 170 \\u00b1 24, 180 \\u00b1 24, and 170 \\u00b1 24 mL, respectively.\"], [\"indacaterol 150 \\u03bcg o.d\", \"placebo\", \"forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) at Week 12\", \"significantly increased\", \"Trough FEV1 (LSM \\u00b1 SEM) at Week 12 was 1.48 \\u00b1 0.018 L for indacaterol and 1.35 \\u00b1 0.019 L for placebo, a clinically relevant difference of 130 \\u00b1 24 mL (p \\u003c 0.001).\"], [\"indacaterol 150 \\u03bcg o.d\", \"placebo\", \"The overall rate of adverse events (ASs)\", \"no significant difference\", \"The overall rates of AEs were comparable between the groups (indacaterol 49.3%, placebo 46.8%)\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

A recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated the efficacy of alvimopan in reducing postoperative ileus and length of stay in cystectomy; however, a major limitation was the exclusion of epidural analgesia.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty–six cystectomy and urinary diversion procedures performed by seven surgeons were analyzed between January 2008 and April 2012. The first 50 patients did not receive alvimopan perioperatively, while the subsequent 36 received a single dose of 12 mg preoperatively and then 12 mg every 12 hours for 15 doses or until discharge.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The groups were equal with respect to age, gender, indication, surgeon, and type of diversion. Patients who received alvimopan experienced a shorter length of stay (LOS) versus those in who did not receive alvimopan (10.5 vs. 8.6 days, p = 0.005, 95% CI 0.6–3.3). Readmission for ileus was low in both alvimopan and control groups (0% and 4.4%, respectively). Costs were significantly lower in the alvimopan group than the control groups (2012 USD 32,443 vs. 40,604 p <0.001). This difference stood up to multivariate analysis with a $7,062 difference in hospital stay.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Use of alvimopan in the routine perioperative care of our cystectomy and urinary diversion patients has decreased LOS by 1.9 days. Additionally, institution of routine perioperative alvimopan has reduced costs by $7,062 per admission (20% reduction). This demonstrates a real world application of alvimopan at a moderate volume center.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"alvimopan\", \"control\", \"Costs\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Costs were significantly lower in the alvimopan group than the control groups (2012 USD 32,443 vs. 40,604 p \\u003c0.001).\"], [\"alvimopan\", \"control\", \"length of stay (LOS)\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Patients who received alvimopan experienced a shorter length of stay (LOS) versus those in who did not receive alvimopan (10.5 vs. 8.6 days, p = 0.005, 95% CI 0.6\\u20133.3).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

This 12-week, double-blind study compared the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of indacaterol to that of placebo in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Efficacy variables included 24-h trough FEV1 (mean of 23 h 10 min and 23 h 45 min post-dose) at Week 12 (primary endpoint) and after Day 1, and the percentage of COPD days with poor control (i.e., worsening symptoms). Safety was assessed by adverse events (AEs), mean serum potassium and blood glucose, QTc (Fridericia), and vital signs.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Patients were randomised (n = 416, mean age 63 years) to receive either indacaterol 150 μg o.d. (n = 211) or placebo (n = 205) via a single-dose dry-powder inhaler; 87.5% completed the study. Trough FEV1 (LSM ± SEM) at Week 12 was 1.48 ± 0.018 L for indacaterol and 1.35 ± 0.019 L for placebo, a clinically relevant difference of 130 ± 24 mL (p < 0.001). Trough FEV1 after one dose was significantly higher with indacaterol than placebo (p < 0.001). Indacaterol demonstrated significantly higher peak FEV1 than placebo, both on Day 1 and at Week 12, with indacaterol-placebo differences (LSM ± SEM) of 190 ± 28 (p < 0.001) and 160 ± 28 mL (p < 0.001), respectively. Standardised AUC measurements for FEV1 (between 5 min and 4 h, 5 min and 1 h, and 1 and 4 h post-dose) at Week 12 were all significantly greater with indacaterol than placebo (p < 0.001), with LSM (± SEM) differences of 170 ± 24, 180 ± 24, and 170 ± 24 mL, respectively. Indacaterol significantly reduced the percentage of days of poor control versus placebo by 22.5% (p < 0.001) and was also associated with significantly reduced use of rescue medication (p < 0.001). The overall rates of AEs were comparable between the groups (indacaterol 49.3%, placebo 46.8%), with the most common AEs being COPD worsening (indacaterol 8.5%, placebo 12.2%) and cough (indacaterol 6.2%, placebo 7.3%). One patient died in the placebo group. Serum potassium and blood glucose levels did not differ significantly between the two groups, and no patient had QTc >500 ms.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Indacaterol 150 μg o.d. provided clinically significant and sustained bronchodilation, reduced rescue medication use, and had a safety and tolerability profile similar to placebo.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT00624286\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"indacaterol 150 μg o.d.\", \"placebo\", \"24-h trough FEV1\", \"significantly increased\", \"Trough FEV1 (LSM ± SEM) at Week 12 was 1.48 ± 0.018 L for indacaterol and 1.35 ± 0.019 L for placebo, a clinically relevant difference of 130 ± 24 mL (p < 0.001).\"],\n    [\"indacaterol 150 μg o.d.\", \"placebo\", \"peak FEV1\", \"significantly increased\", \"Indacaterol demonstrated significantly higher peak FEV1 than placebo, both on Day 1 and at Week 12, with indacaterol-placebo differences (LSM ± SEM) of 190 ± 28 (p < 0.001) and 160 ± 28 mL (p < 0.001), respectively.\"],\n    [\"indacaterol 150 μg o.d.\", \"placebo\", \"standardised AUC measurements for FEV1\", \"significantly increased\", \"Standardised AUC measurements for FEV1 (between 5 min and 4 h, 5 min and 1 h, and 1 and 4 h post-dose) at Week 12 were all significantly greater with indacaterol than placebo (p < 0.001), with LSM (± SEM) differences of 170 ± 24, 180 ± 24, and 170 ± 24 mL, respectively.\"],\n    [\"indacaterol 150 μg o.d.\", \"placebo\", \"percentage of days of poor control\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Indacaterol significantly reduced the percentage of days of poor control versus placebo by 22.5% (p < 0.001).\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"indacaterol 150 μg o.d.\", \"placebo\", \"24-h trough FEV1\", \"significantly increased\", \"Trough FEV1 (LSM ± SEM) at Week 12 was 1.48 ± 0.018 L for indacaterol and 1.35 ± 0.019 L for placebo, a clinically relevant difference of 130 ± 24 mL (p < 0.001).\"],\n    [\"indacaterol 150 μg o.d.\", \"placebo\", \"peak FEV1\", \"significantly increased\", \"Indacaterol demonstrated significantly higher peak FEV1 than placebo, both on Day 1 and at Week 12, with indacaterol-placebo differences (LSM ± SEM) of 190 ± 28 (p < 0.001) and 160 ± 28 mL (p < 0.001), respectively.\"],\n    [\"indacaterol 150 μg o.d.\", \"placebo\", \"standardised AUC measurements for FEV1\", \"significantly increased\", \"Standardised AUC measurements for FEV1 (between 5 min and 4 h, 5 min and 1 h, and 1 and 4 h post-dose) at Week 12 were all significantly greater with indacaterol than placebo (p < 0.001), with LSM (± SEM) differences of 170 ± 24, 180 ± 24, and 170 ± 24 mL, respectively.\"],\n    [\"indacaterol 150 μg o.d.\", \"placebo\", \"percentage of days of poor control\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Indacaterol significantly reduced the percentage of days of poor control versus placebo by 22.5% (p < 0.001).\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "19dfb132735309d7ede0b874478ffa1f98128dd7ba536493ce99eeebdbb58565", "prompt_hash": "c4b32276bc39eb7d90fa197d8fdd701b746b43221d4fb60080b5a5d27a425ac6", "target_hash": "83b5794a51bbe1c07454822a0baf5dcc9747b183603402c99fac7a94eec4f38f", "bypass": null}

This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study assessed the effects of RMD in the colonic transit time (CTT) and defecation characteristics (frequency, stool volume and consistency).\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Sixty-six healthy adult volunteers (32 men) who did not have a daily defecation habit had a 7-day run-in period before the 21-day intervention period with RMD or placebo. CTT and segmental CTT (SCTT) were assessed by a single abdominal X-ray film taken at the end of both periods after radiopaque marker ingestion. Defecation characteristics and intestinal functions were also assessed, which were self-reported by patients. Intragroup comparisons were evaluated by Student's paired t test, Bonferroni test and Chi-square test, while time comparisons by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and time-by-treatment interaction by repeated-measures ANOVA.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Fifty-seven subjects were assessed for CTT (placebo, n = 28; RMD, n = 29). In the RMD group, the total CTT, left SCTT and rectosigmoidal SCTT decreased significantly compared to baseline (p < 0.01 each; −13.3, −4.7, −8.7 h, respectively). Significant differences between groups were observed in total CTT and left SCTT. Significant time-by-treatment interaction was observed in the RMD group for stool volume (p = 0.014), increasing 56 % compared to baseline (p < 0.01), while remained unchanged in the placebo group.

Use of low-dose spinal anesthetic drug with adjuvants is desirable. This study compares the sensorimotor effects of addition of buprenorphine or dexmedetomidine to low-dose bupivacaine.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS:: Sixty patients were randomly allocated to three different groups. All received 1.8 mL 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine intrathecally. Sterile water (0.2 mL) or buprenorphine (60 μg) or dexmedetomidine (5 μg) was added to control group (Group C), buprenorphine group (Group B), and dexmedetomidine group (Group D), respectively. Time to the first analgesic request was the primary objective, and other objectives included the level of sensory-motor block, time to two-segment regression, time to S1 sensory regression and time to complete motor recovery. ANOVA and post hoc test were used for statistical analysis. The value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: All sixty patients completed the study. Postoperative analgesia was not required in the first 24 h in a total of 10 (50%), 12 (60%) and 15 (75%) patients in groups C, B, and D, respectively. Time to S1 regression was 130 ± 46 min (Group C), 144 ± 51.3 min (Group B) and 164 ± 55.99 min (Group D), P = 0.117.

Ten experienced, college-aged men performed four protocols (one per week): no-exercise seated control (CTRL), virtual drumming on a handheld gaming device (HANDHELD), active drumming on drum pads (DRUM), and walking on a treadmill at ~30% of VO2max (WALK). Protocols were performed after an overnight fast, and expired air was collected continuously during (30min) and after (30min) exercise. DRUM and HANDHELD song lists, day of the week, and time of day were identical for each participant. Significant differences (p < 0.05) among the average rates of energy expenditure (kcal·min−1) during activity included WALK > DRUM > HANDHELD. No significant differences in the rates of energy expenditure among groups during recovery were observed. Total energy expenditure was significantly greater (p < 0.05) during WALK (149.5 ± 30.6 kcal) compared to DRUM (118.7 ± 18.8 kcal) and HANDHELD (44.9±11.6 kcal), and greater during DRUM compared to HANDHELD. Total energy expenditure was not significantly different between HANDHELD (44.9 ± 11.6 kcal) and CTRL (38.2 ± 6.0 kcal). Active video game drumming at expert-level significantly increased energy expenditure compared to handheld, but it hardly met moderate-intensity activity standards, and energy expenditure was greatest during walking. Energy expenditure with handheld video game drumming was not different from no-exercise control. Thus, traditional aerobic exercise remains at the forefront for achieving the minimum amount and intensity of physical activity for health, individuals desiring to use video games for achieving weekly physical activity recommendations should choose games that require significant involvement of lower-body musculature, and time spent playing sedentary games should be a limited part of an active lifestyle.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Walking\", \"Drumming on drum pads\", \"Total energy expenditure\", \"significantly increased\", \"Total energy expenditure was significantly greater (p \\u003c 0.05) during WALK (149.5 \\u00b1 30.6 kcal) compared to DRUM (118.7 \\u00b1 18.8 kcal) and HANDHELD (44.9\\u00b111.6 kcal), and greater during DRUM compared to HANDHELD.\"], [\"Walking\", \"Virtual drumming\", \"Total energy expenditure\", \"significantly increased\", \"Total energy expenditure was significantly greater (p \\u003c 0.05) during WALK (149.5 \\u00b1 30.6 kcal) compared to DRUM (118.7 \\u00b1 18.8 kcal) and HANDHELD (44.9\\u00b111.6 kcal), and greater during DRUM compared to HANDHELD.\"], [\"Drumming on drum pads\", \"Virtual drumming \", \"Total energy expenditure\", \"significantly increased\", \"Total energy expenditure was significantly greater (p \\u003c 0.05) during WALK (149.5 \\u00b1 30.6 kcal) compared to DRUM (118.7 \\u00b1 18.8 kcal) and HANDHELD (44.9\\u00b111.6 kcal), and greater during DRUM compared to HANDHELD.\"], [\"Virtual drumming \", \"Control\", \"Total energy expenditure\", \"no significant difference\", \"Total energy expenditure was not significantly different between HANDHELD (44.9 \\u00b1 11.6 kcal) and CTRL (38.2 \\u00b1 6.0 kcal).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

The objective of the Syndromic Surveillance Evaluation Study was to develop and implement standardized supports in local public health agencies in Ontario, Canada, and evaluate the ability of these supports to affect actions taken as part of public health communicable disease control programs.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Local public health agencies (LPHA) in Ontario, which used syndromic surveillance based on emergency department visits for respiratory disease, were recruited and randomly allocated to the study intervention or control group. The intervention group health agencies received standardized supports in terms of a standardized aberrant event detection algorithm and a response protocol dictating steps to investigate and assess the public health significance of syndromic surveillance alerts. The control group continued with their pre-existing syndromic surveillance infrastructure and processes. Outcomes were assessed using logbooks, which collected quantitative and qualitative information about alerts received, investigation steps taken, and public health responses. The study was conducted prospectively for 15 months (October 2013 to February 2015).\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Fifteen LPHAs participated in the study (n = 9 intervention group, n = 6 control group). A total of 1,969 syndromic surveillance alerts were received by all LPHAs. Variations in the types and amount of responses varied by LPHA, in particularly differences were noted by the size of the health unit. Smaller health units had more challenges to both detect and mount a response to any alerts. LPHAs in the control group were more likely to declare alerts to have public health significance and to initiate any action. Regression models using repeated measures showed an interaction between the year (Year 1 versus Year 2) and the intervention as well as an interaction between year and sustained nature of the alert. Both of these were linked to the control health units reporting more \"watchful waiting\".\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: This study raises questions about the effectiveness of using standardized protocols to improve the performance of syndromic surveillance in a decentralized public health system. Despite efforts to create standardized protocols and engage public health agencies in the process, no significant differences in the effective use of syndromic alerts were observed beyond year 1. It also raises questions about the minimum capacity of the agency and minimum population size that are required for an effective response.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Standardized aberrant event detection algorithm and response protocol\", \"Pre-existing syndromic surveillance infrastructure and processes\", \"Effective use of syndromic alerts after 1 year\", \"no significant difference\", \"Despite efforts to create standardized protocols and engage public health agencies in the process, no significant differences in the effective use of syndromic alerts were observed beyond year 1.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

The aim of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant therapy with uracil-tegafur and leucovorin (UFT/LV).\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: In the multicenter, open-label, phase III trial, patients undergoing curative resection of CLM were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the UFT/LV group or surgery alone group. The UFT/LV group orally received 5 cycles of adjuvant UFT/LV (UFT 300mg/m2 and LV 75mg/day for 28 days followed by a 7-day rest per cycle). The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival (RFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS).\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Between February 2004 and December 2010, 180 patients (90 in each group) were enrolled into the study. Of these, 3 patients (2 in the UFT/LV group and 1 in the surgery alone group) were excluded from the efficacy analysis. Median follow-up was 4.76 (range, 0.15–9.84) years. The RFS rate at 3 years was higher in the UFT/LV group (38.6%, n = 88) than in the surgery alone group (32.3%, n = 89). The median RFS in the UFT/LV and surgery alone groups were 1.45 years and 0.70 years, respectively. UFT/LV significantly prolonged the RFS compared with surgery alone with the hazard ratio of 0.56 (95% confidence interval, 0.38–0.83; P = 0.003). The hazard ratio for death of the UFT/LV group against the surgery alone group was not significant (0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.48–1.35; P = 0.409).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Adjuvant therapy with UFT/LV effectively prolongs RFS after hepatic resection for CLM and can be recommended as an alternative choice.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN Clinical Trials Registry C000000013\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"Uracil-tegafur and leucovorin\", \"Control\", \"Recurrence-free survival\", \"significantly increased\", \"UFT/LV significantly prolonged the RFS compared with surgery alone with the hazard ratio of 0.56 (95% confidence interval, 0.38\\u20130.83; P = 0.003)\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:70"}, "target": "[[\"Uracil-tegafur and leucovorin\", \"Control\", \"Recurrence-free survival\", \"significantly increased\", \"UFT/LV significantly prolonged the RFS compared with surgery alone with the hazard ratio of 0.56 (95% confidence interval, 0.38\\u20130.83; P = 0.003)\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

All patients received DFO at 50–60 mg/kg 12–24 hr/day sc or iv 7 times weekly, combined with either DFP 75 at mg/kg/day (combination arm) or placebo (DFO monotherapy arm). The primary endpoint was the change in LVEF by CMR.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Improvement in LVEF was significant in both study arms at 6 and 12 months (p = 0.04), normalizing ventricular function in 9/16 evaluable patients. With combination therapy, the LVEF increased from 49.9% to 55.2% (+5.3% p = 0.04; n = 10) at 6 months and to 58.3% at 12 months (+8.4% p = 0.04; n = 7). With DFO monotherapy, the LVEF increased from 52.8% to 55.7% (+2.9% p = 0.04; n = 6) at 6 months and to 56.9% at 12 months (+4.1% p = 0.04; n = 4). The LVEF trend did not reach statistical difference between study arms (p = 0.89). In 2 patients on DFO monotherapy during the study and in 1 patient on combined therapy during follow up, heart failure deteriorated fatally. The study was originally powered for 86 participants to determine a 5% difference in LVEF improvement between treatments. The study was prematurely terminated due to slow recruitment and with the achieved sample size of 20 patients there was 80% power to detect an 8.6% difference in EF, which was not demonstrated. Myocardial T2* improved in both arms (combination +1.9 ± 1.6 ms p = 0.04; and DFO monotherapy +1.9 ± 1.4 ms p = 0.04), but with no significant difference between treatments (p = 0.65). Liver iron (p = 0.03) and ferritin (p < 0.001) both decreased significantly in only the combination group.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Both treatments significantly improved LVEF and myocardial T2*. Although this is the largest and only randomized study in patients with LV decompensation, further prospective evaluation is needed to identify optimal chelation management in these high-risk patients.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"50\\u201360\\u0026nbsp;mg/kg 12\\u201324\\u0026nbsp;hr/day sc or iv 7 times weekly, combined with either DFP 75 at mg/kg/day (combination arm)\", \"placebo (DFO monotherapy arm)\", \"Improvement in LVEF\", \"no significant difference\", \"The LVEF trend did not reach statistical difference between study arms (p\\u2009=\\u20090.89).\"], [\"50\\u201360\\u0026amp;nbsp;mg/kg 12\\u201324\\u0026amp;nbsp;hr/day sc or iv 7 times weekly, combined with either DFP 75 at mg/kg/day (combination arm)\", \"placebo (DFO monotherapy arm)\", \"Myocardial T2\", \"no significant difference\", \"Myocardial T2* improved in both arms (combination +1.9\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20091.6\\u0026nbsp;ms p\\u2009=\\u20090.04; and DFO monotherapy +1.9\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20091.4\\u0026nbsp;ms p\\u2009=\\u20090.04), but with no significant difference between treatments (p\\u2009=\\u20090.65).\"], [\"50\\u201360\\u0026amp;nbsp;mg/kg 12\\u201324\\u0026amp;nbsp;hr/day sc or iv 7 times weekly, combined with either DFP 75 at mg/kg/day (combination arm)\", \"placebo (DFO monotherapy arm)\", \"Myocardial T2\", \"no significant difference\", \"Myocardial T2* improved in both arms (combination +1.9\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20091.6\\u00a0ms p\\u2009=\\u20090.04; and DFO monotherapy +1.9\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20091.4\\u00a0ms p\\u2009=\\u20090.04), but with no significant difference between treatments (p\\u2009=\\u20090.65).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

The aim of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant therapy with uracil-tegafur and leucovorin (UFT/LV).\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: In the multicenter, open-label, phase III trial, patients undergoing curative resection of CLM were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the UFT/LV group or surgery alone group. The UFT/LV group orally received 5 cycles of adjuvant UFT/LV (UFT 300mg/m2 and LV 75mg/day for 28 days followed by a 7-day rest per cycle). The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival (RFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS).\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Between February 2004 and December 2010, 180 patients (90 in each group) were enrolled into the study. Of these, 3 patients (2 in the UFT/LV group and 1 in the surgery alone group) were excluded from the efficacy analysis. Median follow-up was 4.76 (range, 0.15–9.84) years. The RFS rate at 3 years was higher in the UFT/LV group (38.6%, n = 88) than in the surgery alone group (32.3%, n = 89). The median RFS in the UFT/LV and surgery alone groups were 1.45 years and 0.70 years, respectively. UFT/LV significantly prolonged the RFS compared with surgery alone with the hazard ratio of 0.56 (95% confidence interval, 0.38–0.83; P = 0.003). The hazard ratio for death of the UFT/LV group against the surgery alone group was not significant (0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.48–1.35; P = 0.409).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Adjuvant therapy with UFT/LV effectively prolongs RFS after hepatic resection for CLM and can be recommended as an alternative choice.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN Clinical Trials Registry C000000013\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[[\"5 cycles of adjuvant UFT/LV (UFT 300mg/m2 and LV 75mg/day for 28 days followed by a 7-day rest per cycle)\", \"surgery alone\", \"recurrence-free survival (RFS)\", \"significantly increased\", \"UFT/LV significantly prolonged the RFS compared with surgery alone with the hazard ratio of 0.56 (95% confidence interval, 0.38\\u2009\\u2013\\u20090.83; P\\u2009=\\u20090.003).\"]]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[[\"5 cycles of adjuvant UFT/LV (UFT 300mg/m2 and LV 75mg/day for 28 days followed by a 7-day rest per cycle)\", \"surgery alone\", \"recurrence-free survival (RFS)\", \"significantly increased\", \"UFT/LV significantly prolonged the RFS compared with surgery alone with the hazard ratio of 0.56 (95% confidence interval, 0.38\\u2009\\u2013\\u20090.83; P\\u2009=\\u20090.003).\"]]"], "doc_hash": "6534b31e4daa0a1195b22c2c980b7ce12e90f56dcd36008f86f49b5692e0ce67", "prompt_hash": "004ed3443b8ff376164ca482de70188e8479cc161a881af2a02c86bc23f970d9", "target_hash": "3a4beed71ad992490e5299986dc273116a05bf3181508b984460bb8b2f060638", "bypass": null}

This exploratory study investigated whether two mind–body interventions, i.e., Mind–Body Bridging (MBB) and Mindfulness Meditation (MM), could improve posttreatment cancer survivors' self-reported sleep disturbance and comorbid symptoms, as compared to sleep hygiene education (SHE) as an active control.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: This randomized controlled trial examined 57 cancer survivors with clinically significant self-reported sleep disturbance, randomly assigned to receive MBB, MM, or SHE. All interventions were conducted in three sessions, once per week. Patient-reported outcomes were assessed via the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale and other indicators of psychosocial functioning relevant to quality of life, stress, depression, mindfulness, self-compassion, and well-being.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Mixed effects model analysis revealed that mean sleep disturbance symptoms in the MBB (p = .0029) and MM (p = .0499) groups were lower than in the SHE group, indicating that both mind–body interventions improved sleep. In addition, compared with the SHE group, the MBB group showed reductions in self-reported depression symptoms (p = .040) and improvements in overall levels of mindfulness (p = .018), self-compassion (p = .028), and well-being (p = .019) at postintervention.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence that brief sleep-focused MBB and MM are promising interventions for sleep disturbance in cancer survivors. Integrating MBB or MM into posttreatment supportive plans should enhance care of cancer survivors with sleep disturbance. Because MBB produced additional secondary benefits, MBB may serve as a promising multipurpose intervention for posttreatment cancer survivors suffering from sleep disturbance and other comorbid symptoms.\n\nABSTRACT.IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Two brief sleep-focused mind–body interventions investigated in the study were effective in reducing sleep disturbance and one of them further improved other psychosocial aspects of the cancer survivors' life.

Replacement with fixed ratio co‐administration of insulin and the amylin analogue pramlintide may be superior to separate dosing. This concept was evaluated in a ratio‐finding study. Patients with type 1 diabetes were enrolled in a randomized, single‐masked, standard breakfast crossover study using regular human insulin injected simultaneously with pramlintide 6, 9 or 12 mcg/unit insulin or placebo. Insulin dosage was reduced by 30% from patients' usual estimates. Plasma glucose, glucagon and pramlintide and adverse events were assessed. All ratios reduced 0–3‐h glucose and glucagon increments by >50%. No hypoglycaemia occurred. Adverse events were infrequent and generally mild. All pramlintide/insulin ratios markedly and safely reduced glycaemic excursions and suppressed glucagon secretion in the immediate postprandial state. Further study using one of these ratios to explore the efficacy and safety of longer‐term meal‐time and basal hormone replacement is warranted.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"Insulin + Pramlintide (6 mcg/U)\", \"Insulin + Pramlintide (12 mcg/U)\", \"Elevation of glucose and glucagon after 1 hour\", \"no significant difference\", \"All ratios reduced 0\\u20133\\u2010h glucose and glucagon increments by \\u003e50%.\"], [\"Insulin + Pramlintide (all doses)\", \"Insulin alone\", \"Hypoglycemia after 24 hours\", \"no significant difference\", \"No hypoglycaemia occurred.\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:72"}, "target": "[[\"Insulin + Pramlintide (6 mcg/U)\", \"Insulin + Pramlintide (12 mcg/U)\", \"Elevation of glucose and glucagon after 1 hour\", \"no significant difference\", \"All ratios reduced 0\\u20133\\u2010h glucose and glucagon increments by \\u003e50%.\"], [\"Insulin + Pramlintide (all doses)\", \"Insulin alone\", \"Hypoglycemia after 24 hours\", \"no significant difference\", \"No hypoglycaemia occurred.\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

Replacement with fixed ratio co‐administration of insulin and the amylin analogue pramlintide may be superior to separate dosing. This concept was evaluated in a ratio‐finding study. Patients with type 1 diabetes were enrolled in a randomized, single‐masked, standard breakfast crossover study using regular human insulin injected simultaneously with pramlintide 6, 9 or 12 mcg/unit insulin or placebo. Insulin dosage was reduced by 30% from patients' usual estimates. Plasma glucose, glucagon and pramlintide and adverse events were assessed. All ratios reduced 0–3‐h glucose and glucagon increments by >50%. No hypoglycaemia occurred. Adverse events were infrequent and generally mild. All pramlintide/insulin ratios markedly and safely reduced glycaemic excursions and suppressed glucagon secretion in the immediate postprandial state. Further study using one of these ratios to explore the efficacy and safety of longer‐term meal‐time and basal hormone replacement is warranted.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[[\"insulin and pramlintide\", \"placebo\", \"0–3h glucose increments\", \"significantly decreased\", \"All ratios reduced 0–3-h glucose and glucagon increments by >50%.

Since these reductions may lead to dangerous complications, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of vasopressors and isotonic fluids on hemodynamic status of cardiac surgery patients during their transfer to ICU.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: This randomized single-blind clinical trial was conducted in Chamran Hospital (Isfahan, Iran). A total number of 75 consecutive patients undergoing planned first-time coronary artery bypass grafting entered our study. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), CVP, and pulse rate (PR) were recorded at 5 to 10 minutes before leaving operating room and immediately after hospitalization in the ICU. Subjects in the first group received 7 cc/kg intravenous normal saline (as an isotonic fluid) within 5-10 minutes. The second group received 10 mg ephedrine before being transferred to the ICU.\n\nABSTRACT. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 61.0 ± 3.6 years. No significant change in PR was detected in normal saline group (P > 0.05). No significant differences were found in two groups in SBP before and after hospitalization in the ICU (P > 0.05). DBP and CVP had statistically significant reductions in both groups after hospitalization in the ICU (P < 0.001). The mean CVP was also reduced significantly (10.7 ± 2.9 vs. 8.2 ± 3.4; P < 0.001).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Significant reductions in mean values of DBP and CVP occur during cardiac surgery and after arrival to the ICU. These reductions cannot be prevented by administration of vasopressors, such as ephedrine, or infusion of isotonic fluids, such as normal saline. Further studies are required to assess whether more fluids, other types of fluids, or other drugs can stop this phenomenon.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"Ephedrine\", \"Control (nothing)\", \"Systolic blood preasure\", \"no significant difference\", \"No significant differences were found in two groups in SBP before and after hospitalization in the ICU (P \\u003e 0.05)\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:73"}, "target": "[[\"Ephedrine\", \"Control (nothing)\", \"Systolic blood preasure\", \"no significant difference\", \"No significant differences were found in two groups in SBP before and after hospitalization in the ICU (P \\u003e 0.05)\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and tolerability of bilastine following single and multiple oral doses in healthy Japanese subjects. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles were compared with those reported in Caucasian subjects.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: In a single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, single- and multiple-ascending dose study, bilastine tablets were administered at single doses of 10, 20, and 50 mg (Part I), and once daily for 14 days at 20 and 50 mg (Part II).\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: After single oral doses, maximum plasma concentrations (C\nmax) were reached at 1.0–1.5 h postdose. Plasma exposure [C\nmax and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC)] increased dose-proportionally at single doses of 10–50 mg. In repeated-dose administration, no remarkable differences were observed between Day 1 and Day 14 for C\nmax or AUC. For inhibitory effects on wheal and flare response, bilastine 20 and 50 mg showed significant inhibition from 1.5 h after administration as compared with placebo, and the significant effect persisted for 24 h after administration. The rates of adverse events (AEs) were comparable between bilastine and placebo in both Part I and Part II. In addition, no dose- or administration period-dependent tendency of increase in rate of AEs or worsening of severity was observed.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Bilastine exhibits similar single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics in healthy Japanese subjects compared with those observed in Caucasian subjects in previous studies.\n\nABSTRACT.ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s40261-016-0447-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Bilastine 10 mg\", \"Placebo\", \"Adverse effects\", \"no significant difference\", \"The rates of adverse events (AEs) were comparable between bilastine and placebo in both Part I and Part II.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and tolerability of bilastine following single and multiple oral doses in healthy Japanese subjects. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles were compared with those reported in Caucasian subjects.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: In a single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, single- and multiple-ascending dose study, bilastine tablets were administered at single doses of 10, 20, and 50 mg (Part I), and once daily for 14 days at 20 and 50 mg (Part II).\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: After single oral doses, maximum plasma concentrations (C\nmax) were reached at 1.0–1.5 h postdose. Plasma exposure [C\nmax and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC)] increased dose-proportionally at single doses of 10–50 mg. In repeated-dose administration, no remarkable differences were observed between Day 1 and Day 14 for C\nmax or AUC. For inhibitory effects on wheal and flare response, bilastine 20 and 50 mg showed significant inhibition from 1.5 h after administration as compared with placebo, and the significant effect persisted for 24 h after administration. The rates of adverse events (AEs) were comparable between bilastine and placebo in both Part I and Part II. In addition, no dose- or administration period-dependent tendency of increase in rate of AEs or worsening of severity was observed.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Bilastine exhibits similar single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics in healthy Japanese subjects compared with those observed in Caucasian subjects in previous studies.\n\nABSTRACT.ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s40261-016-0447-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"Bilastine 10 mg\", \"Placebo\", \"Adverse effects\", \"no significant difference\", \"The rates of adverse events (AEs) were comparable between bilastine and placebo in both Part I and Part II.\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:75"}, "target": "[[\"Bilastine 10 mg\", \"Placebo\", \"Adverse effects\", \"no significant difference\", \"The rates of adverse events (AEs) were comparable between bilastine and placebo in both Part I and Part II.\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

To evaluate the efficacy of epoetin-α prior to revision total knee arthroplasty, we hypothesized that epoetin-α will reduce blood transfusion. Methods. Eighty-one patients were compared in this retrospective review; twenty-eight patients received our dosing regimen. All patients were mildly anemic. Epoetin-α to control (1 : 2) patient matching occurred so that one of two attending surgeons, gender, BMI, complexity of surgery, ASA score, and age were similar between groups. The clinical triggers for blood transfusion during or after the procedure were determined based on peri- and postoperative hemoglobin levels, ASA score, and/or clinical symptoms consistent with anemia. Blood salvage was not used. Results. Blood transfusion and length of stay were lower in the study group. None of the patients who received epoetin-α underwent transfusion. Hemoglobin increased from 11.97 to 13.8, preoperatively. Hemoglobin at day of surgery and time of discharge were higher. Gender, BMI, ASA score, total and hidden blood losses, calculated blood loss, preop PLT, PT, PTT, and INR were similar between groups. One Epogen patient had an uncomplicated DVT (3.6%). Conclusions. Epoetin-α may have a role in the mildly anemic revision knee patient. It may also decrease patient length of stay allowing for earlier readiness to resume normal activities and/or meet short-term milestones. A randomized study to evaluate the direct and indirect costs of such a treatment methodology in the mildly anemic revision patient may be warranted.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"epoetin-\\u03b1\", \"control\", \"average total blood loss\", \"no significant difference\", \"Gender, BMI, ASA score, total and hidden blood losses, calculated blood loss, preop PLT, PT, PTT, and INR were similar between groups.\"], [\"epoetin-\\u03b1\", \"control\", \"hidden blood loss\", \"no significant difference\", \"Gender, BMI, ASA score, total and hidden blood losses, calculated blood loss, preop PLT, PT, PTT, and INR were similar between groups.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

However, most studies used SMS only as a medication reminder, with few studies exploring the effect of comprehensive, interactive SMS.\n\nABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, 100 HIV-positive patients on ART for <3 months were randomized into control or intervention arm. Participants in the control group received routine standard instruction for ART medication in the HIV clinics, while the intervention group received 6 months of an SMS intervention in addition to the standard care. A total of 124 text messages within 6 modules were edited, preinstalled, and sent to participants according to personalized schedules. Knowledge (of HIV and HIV medications), self-reported antiretroviral adherence (Visual Analog Scale [VAS] and Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS [CPCRA] Antiretroviral Medication Self-Report), and CD4 count were assessed at baseline and immediate post-intervention. Intervention participants were interviewed after completion of the study about their satisfaction with and acceptability of the SMS intervention.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Baseline assessments were comparable between arms. Repeated-measures analysis showed that both HIV-related and ART medication knowledge of the intervention group showed better improvement over time than those of the control group after the intervention (P<0.0001). For the adherence measures, compared with the control group, participants in the intervention group had significantly higher VAS mean score (Z=2.735, P=0.006) and lower suboptimal adherence rate (Z=2.208, P=0.027) at the end of the study. The intervention had no effect on CD4 cell count. Almost all (96%) intervention participants reported satisfaction or high satisfaction with the SMS intervention, with 74% desiring to continue to receive the SMS intervention. The preferred frequency of messages was 1–2 messages per week.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: An interactive SMS intervention with comprehensive content shows promising efficacy in promoting medication adherence in ART-naïve individuals.

Group 1 (experimental group) consisted of 20 (40 ears) individuals exposed to occupational noise with hearing thresholds within 25 dB HL. They were further divided into three subgroups based on duration of noise exposure (0–5 years of exposure-T1, 5–10 years of exposure-T2, and >10 years of exposure-T3). Group 2 (control group) consisted of 20 individuals (40 ears). Absolute latency and amplitude of waves I, III, and V were compared between the two groups for both click and CE-chirp stimuli. T1, T2, and T3 groups were compared for the same parameters to see the effect of noise exposure duration on CE-chirp and click ABR.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULT:: In Click ABR, while both the parameters for wave III were significantly poorer for the experimental group, wave V showed a significant decline in terms of amplitude only. There was no significant difference obtained for any of the parameters for wave I. In CE-Chirp ABR, the latencies for all three waves were significantly prolonged in the experimental group. However, there was a significant decrease in terms of amplitude in only wave V for the same group.\n\nABSTRACT.DISCUSSION:: Compared to click evoked ABR, CE-Chirp ABR was found to be more sensitive in comparison of latency parameters in individuals with occupational noise exposure. Monitoring of early pathological changes at the brainstem level can be studied effectively by using CE-Chirp stimulus in comparison to click stimulus.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: This study indicates that ABR's obtained with CE-chirp stimuli serves as an effective tool to identify the early pathological changes due to occupational noise exposure when compared to click evoked ABR.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"CE-chirp ABR\", \"click ABR\", \"wave I\", \"no significant difference\", \".

A total of 120 consecutive patients were allocated alternately to the two study groups: perioperative immunomodulation with IL-2 (IL-2 group; n=60) and perioperative immunomonitoring without immunomodulation (control group; n=60). Patients from the IL-2 group received four doses of 10 × 106 IU m−2 twice daily subcutaneously a week before operation followed by a daily maintenance dose of 3 × 106 IU m−2 subcutaneously until a day before the operation. Parameters of cellular and humoral immunity (leucocytes, T-cell markers CD3, CD4, and CD8, B-cell marker CD19, monocyte marker CD14, natural killer (NK) cell markers CD16, CD56, and CD57, activation markers CD6, CD25, CD28, and CD69, progenitor cell marker CD34, as well as IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, soluble IL-2 receptor, IL-1 receptor antagonist, transforming growth factor-β1, and vascular endothelial growth factor) were measured in peripheral venous blood at various intervals. Interleukin-2-related toxicity was WHO grade 1 (24%), 2 (67%), and 3 (9%). In the postoperative period, T-cell markers, activation markers, and NK cell markers decreased, and IL-6 and IL-10 increased. However, all these alterations were significantly less accentuated in patients who had been pretreated with IL-2. Median follow-up was 40 months.

The optimal framework to categorize clinical trials according to risk remains unclear, however. Switzerland is the first European country to adopt a risk-based categorization procedure in January 2014. We assessed how accurately and consistently clinical trials are categorized using two different approaches: an approach using criteria set forth in the new law (concept) or an intuitive approach (ad hoc).\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS:: This was a randomized controlled trial with a method-comparison study nested in each arm. We used clinical trial protocols from eight Swiss ethics committees approved between 2010 and 2011. Protocols were randomly assigned to be categorized in one of three risk categories using the concept or the ad hoc approach. Each protocol was independently categorized by the trial's sponsor, a group of experts and the approving ethics committee. The primary outcome was the difference in categorization agreement between the expert group and sponsors across arms. Linear weighted kappa was used to quantify agreements, with the difference between kappas being the primary effect measure.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: We included 142 of 231 protocols in the final analysis (concept = 78; ad hoc = 64). Raw agreement between the expert group and sponsors was 0.74 in the concept and 0.78 in the ad hoc arm. Chance-corrected agreement was higher in the ad hoc (kappa: 0.34 (95% confidence interval = 0.10–0.58)) than in the concept arm (0.27 (0.06–0.50)), but the difference was not significant (p = 0.67).\n\nABSTRACT.LIMITATIONS:: The main limitation was the large number of protocols excluded from the analysis mostly because they did not fit with the clinical trial definition of the new law.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: A structured risk categorization approach was not better than an ad hoc approach. Laws introducing risk-based approaches should provide guidelines, examples and templates to ensure correct application.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"New law criteria (Concept)\", \"Intuitive approach (ad hoc)\", \"Agreement between Experts and Sponsors\", \"no significant difference\", \"Raw agreement between the expert group and sponsors was 0.74 in the concept and 0.78 in the ad hoc arm.

A total of 120 consecutive patients were allocated alternately to the two study groups: perioperative immunomodulation with IL-2 (IL-2 group; n=60) and perioperative immunomonitoring without immunomodulation (control group; n=60). Patients from the IL-2 group received four doses of 10 × 106 IU m−2 twice daily subcutaneously a week before operation followed by a daily maintenance dose of 3 × 106 IU m−2 subcutaneously until a day before the operation. Parameters of cellular and humoral immunity (leucocytes, T-cell markers CD3, CD4, and CD8, B-cell marker CD19, monocyte marker CD14, natural killer (NK) cell markers CD16, CD56, and CD57, activation markers CD6, CD25, CD28, and CD69, progenitor cell marker CD34, as well as IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, soluble IL-2 receptor, IL-1 receptor antagonist, transforming growth factor-β1, and vascular endothelial growth factor) were measured in peripheral venous blood at various intervals. Interleukin-2-related toxicity was WHO grade 1 (24%), 2 (67%), and 3 (9%). In the postoperative period, T-cell markers, activation markers, and NK cell markers decreased, and IL-6 and IL-10 increased. However, all these alterations were significantly less accentuated in patients who had been pretreated with IL-2. Median follow-up was 40 months. Tumour-specific survival in the IL-2 group and the control group was 98 vs 81% after 1 year and 86 vs 73% after 5 years (P=0.04). A similar effect was found for progression-free survival.

These results suggest that balance training is capable of improving particularly memory and spatial cognition. Therefore, an increase in cardiorespiratory fitness does not seem to be necessary to induce beneficial effects of physical exercise on cognition.

On the other hand, the importance of participatory care and high effectiveness of self-management programs have been confirmed. This study was aimed to examine the effect of an educational intervention on self-efficacy, self-care behaviors and blood pressure (BP) of hypertensive obese or overweight women in the primary health-care setting in Isfahan, Iran.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was an educational intervention program. It was performed among 146 hypertensive women of 30-65 age range who referred to 6 health care centers of Isfahan that randomly assigned to a control and intervention groups. The interventional group participated in the 6 weekly sessions including exercises, weight control, medication adherence, and home self-monitoring based on goal setting, and promotion of self-efficacy. The control group received routine care from health-care center and any special intervention has been done for the control group. Output variables were analyzed after intervention, and 6-month follow-up.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: There are no significant differences between age, weight, body mass index and BP and biochemical variables except lipids as well as behavioral factors at the baseline. After 6 months intervention self-efficacy (< 0.001) and physical activity (< 0.001) improvement of in the intervention group was significantly different in comparison with the control group. After 6 months, there was a significant reduction in systolic (P < 0.001) and diastolic BP (P = 0.010) in the intervention group.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Participatory method of education could help us to convince patients to have better self-care to control disease. Furthermore, since adherence to the treatment of hypertensive patients in our society is low, organizing such courses can teach essential knowledge and skills to lifestyle change and prevention of complications. Performing these courses is recommended for other chronic disease patients in health-care centers to assess self-management programs on self-care behavior.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"6 weekly sessions including exercises, weight control, medication adherence, and home self-monitoring\", \"routine care from health-care center\", \"average of physical activity\", \"significantly increased\", \"After 6 months intervention self-efficacy (\\u003c 0.001) and physical activity (\\u003c 0.001) improvement of in the intervention group was significantly different in comparison with the control group.\"], [\"6 weekly sessions including exercises, weight control, medication adherence, and home self-monitoring\", \"routine care from health-care center\", \"systolic and diastolic BP\", \"significantly decreased\", \"After 6 months, there was a significant reduction in systolic (P \\u003c 0.001) and diastolic BP (P = 0.010) in the intervention group.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, two-period crossover study in adult patients receiving around-the-clock full opioid agonist therapy and confirmed to be opioid dependent by naloxone challenge. Study doses were substituted at the time of the regular dose schedule for each patient. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a maximum Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale score ≥ 13 (moderate withdrawal) or use of rescue medication. <p> Results. 35 subjects on ≥ 80 mg morphine sulfate equivalent per day were evaluable for opioid withdrawal. One patient during buccal buprenorphine treatment and two during 50% full μ-opioid agonist treatment experienced opioid withdrawal of at least moderate intensity. The mean maximum Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale scores were similar, and numerically lower on buccal buprenorphine. There were no significant differences in pain ratings between treatments. The most frequent adverse events with buccal buprenorphine were headache (19%), vomiting (13%), nausea, diarrhea, and drug withdrawal syndrome (each 9%), and with full μ-opioid agonist were headache (16%), drug withdrawal syndrome (13%), and nausea (6%). <p> Conclusions. Chronic pain patients treated with around-the-clock full μ-opioid agonist therapy can be switched to buccal buprenorphine (a partial μ-opioid agonist) at approximately 50% of the full μ-opioid agonist dose without an increased risk of opioid withdrawal or loss of pain control.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"Buccal buprenorphine (BBUP)\", \"Full \\u03bc-opioid agonist*\", \"pain ratings\", \"no significant difference\", \"There were no significant differences in pain ratings between treatments.\"], [\"Buccal buprenorphine (BBUP)\", \"Full \\u03bc-opioid agonist*\", \"Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale(COWS) - 24-hour period\", \"no significant difference\", \"The mean maximum Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale scores were similar, and numerically lower on buccal buprenorphine\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:79"}, "target": "[[\"Buccal buprenorphine (BBUP)\", \"Full \\u03bc-opioid agonist*\", \"pain ratings\", \"no significant difference\", \"There were no significant differences in pain ratings between treatments.\"], [\"Buccal buprenorphine (BBUP)\", \"Full \\u03bc-opioid agonist*\", \"Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale(COWS) - 24-hour period\", \"no significant difference\", \"The mean maximum Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale scores were similar, and numerically lower on buccal buprenorphine\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

Novel and more efficient preventive strategies are therefore warranted. Abnormal excitability of cortical areas appears to play a pivotal role in migraine pathophysiology. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive and safe technique that is able to durably modulate the activity of the underlying cerebral cortex, and is being tested in various medical indications. The results of small open studies using tDCS in migraine prophylaxis are conflicting, possibly because the optimal stimulation settings and the brain targets were not well chosen. We have previously shown that the cerebral cortex, especially the visual cortex, is hyperresponsive in migraine patients between attacks and provided evidence from evoked potential studies that this is due to a decreased cortical preactivation level. If one accepts this concept, anodal tDCS over the visual cortex may have therapeutic potentials in migraine prevention, as it is able to increase neuronal firing.\n\nABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of anodal tDCS on visual cortex activity in healthy volunteers (HV) and episodic migraine without aura patients (MoA), and its potentials for migraine prevention.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: We recorded pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials (VEP) before and after a 15-min session of anodal tDCS over the visual cortex in 11 HV and 13 MoA interictally. Then 10 MoA patients reporting at least 4 attacks/month subsequently participated in a therapeutic study, and received 2 similar sessions of tDCS per week for 8 weeks as migraine preventive therapy.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: In HV as well as in MoA, anodal tDCS transiently increased habituation of the VEP N1P1 component. VEP amplitudes were not modified by tDCS. Preventive treatment with anodal tDCS turned out to be beneficial in MoA: migraine attack frequency, migraine days, attack duration and acute medication intake significantly decreased during the treatment period compared to pre-treatment baseline (all p < 0.05), and this benefit persisted on average 4.8 weeks after the end of tDCS.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Anodal tDCS over the visual cortex is thus able to increase habituation to repetitive visual stimuli in healthy volunteers and in episodic migraineurs, who on average lack habituation interictally. Moreover, 2 weekly sessions of anodal tDCS had a significant preventive anti- migraine effect, proofing the concept that the low preactivation level of the visual cortex in migraine patients can be corrected by an activating neurostimulation. The therapeutic results indicate that a larger sham-controlled trial using the same tDCS protocol is worthwhile.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)\", \"baseline\", \"acute medication intake\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Preventive treatment with anodal tDCS turned out to be beneficial in MoA: migraine attack frequency, migraine days, attack duration and acute medication intake significantly decreased during the treatment period compared to pre-treatment baseline (all p \\u003c 0.05), and this benefit persisted on average 4.8 weeks after the end of tDCS.\"], [\"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)\", \"baseline\", \"migraine attack frequency, migraine days, attack duration \", \"significantly decreased\", \"Preventive treatment with anodal tDCS turned out to be beneficial in MoA: migraine attack frequency, migraine days, attack duration and acute medication intake significantly decreased during the treatment period compared to pre-treatment baseline (all p \\u003c 0.05),\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, two-period crossover study in adult patients receiving around-the-clock full opioid agonist therapy and confirmed to be opioid dependent by naloxone challenge. Study doses were substituted at the time of the regular dose schedule for each patient. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a maximum Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale score ≥ 13 (moderate withdrawal) or use of rescue medication. <p> Results. 35 subjects on ≥ 80 mg morphine sulfate equivalent per day were evaluable for opioid withdrawal. One patient during buccal buprenorphine treatment and two during 50% full μ-opioid agonist treatment experienced opioid withdrawal of at least moderate intensity. The mean maximum Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale scores were similar, and numerically lower on buccal buprenorphine. There were no significant differences in pain ratings between treatments. The most frequent adverse events with buccal buprenorphine were headache (19%), vomiting (13%), nausea, diarrhea, and drug withdrawal syndrome (each 9%), and with full μ-opioid agonist were headache (16%), drug withdrawal syndrome (13%), and nausea (6%). <p> Conclusions. Chronic pain patients treated with around-the-clock full μ-opioid agonist therapy can be switched to buccal buprenorphine (a partial μ-opioid agonist) at approximately 50% of the full μ-opioid agonist dose without an increased risk of opioid withdrawal or loss of pain control.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[[\"buccal buprenorphine\", \"50% full μ-opioid agonist\", \"maximum Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale score ≥ 13\", \"significantly decreased\", \"One patient during buccal buprenorphine treatment and two during 50% full μ-opioid agonist treatment experienced opioid withdrawal of at least moderate intensity.\"], [\"buccal buprenorphine\", \"50% full μ-opioid agonist\", \"pain ratings\", \"no significant difference\", \"There were no significant differences in pain ratings between treatments.\"]]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[[\"buccal buprenorphine\", \"50% full μ-opioid agonist\", \"maximum Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale score ≥ 13\", \"significantly decreased\", \"One patient during buccal buprenorphine treatment and two during 50% full μ-opioid agonist treatment experienced opioid withdrawal of at least moderate intensity.\"], [\"buccal buprenorphine\", \"50% full μ-opioid agonist\", \"pain ratings\", \"no significant difference\", \"There were no significant differences in pain ratings between treatments.\"]]"], "doc_hash": "0855379ec507c8a10a1fde0958708e640e0e0894daf39a6c28c4db3fd3c52453", "prompt_hash": "2cec6ba305dea409cc2033fb3695746465bf5a27b123da813d7b9866702919d3", "target_hash": "6ce2fc341558dc58913c86b502895bee7ba33867de14bfdefb6209b4c9d2f2fd", "bypass": null}

Volatile anesthetics induce cardioprotection in humans undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. We hypothesized that helium induces pre- and postconditioning in CABG-patients, affecting signaling molecules protein kinase C-epsilon (PKC-ε), p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK-1/2) and heat shock protein 27 (HSP-27) within cardiac tissue, and reducing postoperative troponin levels.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: After ethical approval and informed consent, 125 elective patients undergoing CABG surgery were randomised into this prospective, placebo controlled, investigator blinded, parallel arm single-centre study. Helium preconditioning (3 × 5 min of 70 % helium and 30 % oxygen) was applied before aortic cross clamping; postconditioning (15 min of helium) was applied before release of the aortic cross clamp. Signaling molecules were measured in right atrial appendix specimens. Troponin-T was measured at 4, 12, 24 and 48 h postoperatively.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Baseline characteristics of all groups were similar. Helium preconditioning did not significantly alter the primary outcome (molecular levels of kinases PKC-ε and HSP-27, ratio of activated p38 MAPK or ERK 1⁄2). Postoperative troponin T was 11 arbitrary units [5, 31; area-under-the-curve (interquartile range)] for controls, and no statistically significant changes were observed after helium preconditioning [He-pre: 11 (6, 18)], helium postconditioning [He-post: 11 (8, 15)], helium pre- and postconditioning [He-PP: 14 (6, 20)] and after sevoflurane preconditioning [APC: 12 (8, 24), p = 0.13]. No adverse effects related to study treatment were observed in this study.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: No effect was observed of helium preconditioning, postconditioning or the combination thereof on activation of p38 MAPK, ERK 1/2 or levels of HSP27 and PKC-ε in the human heart.

The primary end point was trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) at Week 26. Other key end points included peak FEV1, area under the curve for FEV1 from 5 minutes to 4 hours (FEV1 AUC5 min–4 h), Transition Dyspnea Index focal score, St George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score, and safety. Here, we present efficacy and safety of IND/GLY in the Japanese subgroup.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Of 2,144 patients from the SHINE study, 182 (8.5%) were Japanese and randomized to IND/GLY (n=42), IND (n=41), GLY (n=40), TIO (n=40), or placebo (n=19). Improvement in trough FEV1 from baseline was 190 mL with IND/GLY and treatment differences versus IND (90 mL), GLY (100 mL), TIO (90 mL), and placebo (280 mL) along with a rapid onset of action at Week 26. IND/GLY showed an improvement in FEV1 AUC5 min–4 h versus all comparators (all P<0.05). All the treatments were well tolerated and showed comparable effect on Transition Dyspnea Index focal score and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score. The effect of IND/GLY in the Japanese subgroup was consistent to overall SHINE study population.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: IND/GLY demonstrated superior efficacy and comparable safety compared with its monocomponents, open-label TIO, and placebo and may be used as a treatment option for the management of moderate-to-severe COPD in Japanese patients.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"indacaterol (IND)/glycopyrronium (GLY) 110/50 \\u03bcg once daily\", \"GLY 50 \\u03bcg od, IND 150 \\u03bcg od, open-label tiotropium (TIO) 18 \\u03bcg od, and placebo\", \"forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)\", \"significantly increased\", \"IND/GLY showed an improvement in FEV1 AUC5 min\\u20134 h versus all comparators (all P\\u0026lt;0.05).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

We investigated the possible effects of Bifidobacterium animalisssp. lactis 420 (B420) and the dietary fiber Litesse® Ultra polydextrose (LU) on body fat mass and other obesity-related parameters.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: 225 healthy volunteers (healthy, BMI 28–34.9) were randomized into four groups (1:1:1:1), using a computer-generated sequence, for 6 months of double-blind, parallel treatment: 1) Placebo, microcrystalline cellulose, 12 g/d; 2) LU, 12 g/d; 3) B420, 1010 CFU/d in microcrystalline cellulose, 12 g/d; 4) LU + B420, 12 g + 1010 CFU/d. Body composition was monitored with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and the primary outcome was relative change in body fat mass, comparing treatment groups to Placebo. Other outcomes included anthropometric measurements, food intake and blood and fecal biomarkers. The study was registered in Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01978691).\n\nABSTRACT.FINDINGS: There were marked differences in the results of the Intention-To-Treat (ITT; n = 209) and Per Protocol (PP; n = 134) study populations. The PP analysis included only those participants who completed the intervention with > 80% product compliance and no antibiotic use. In addition, three participants were excluded from DXA analyses for PP due to a long delay between the end of intervention and the last DXA measurement. There were no significant differences between groups in body fat mass in the ITT population. However, LU + B420 and B420 seemed to improve weight management in the PP population. For relative change in body fat mass, LU + B420 showed a − 4.5% (− 1.4 kg, P = 0.02, N = 37) difference to the Placebo group, whereas LU (+ 0.3%, P = 1.00, N = 35) and B420 (− 3.0%, P = 0.28, N = 24) alone had no effect (overall ANOVA P = 0.095, Placebo N = 35). A post-hoc factorial analysis was significant for B420 (− 4.0%, P = 0.002 vs. Placebo). Changes in fat mass were most pronounced in the abdominal region, and were reflected by similar changes in waist circumference. B420 and LU + B420 also significantly reduced energy intake compared to Placebo. Changes in blood zonulin levels and hsCRP were associated with corresponding changes in trunk fat mass in the LU + B420 group and in the overall population. There were no differences between groups in the incidence of adverse events.\n\nABSTRACT.DISCUSSION: This clinical trial demonstrates that a probiotic product with or without dietary fiber controls body fat mass. B420 and LU + B420 also reduced waist circumference and food intake, whereas LU alone had no effect on the measured outcomes.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Litesse\\u00ae Ultra polydextrose  \\u0301+ Bifidobacterium animalisssp. lactis 420\", \"Placebo\", \"Energy intake\", \"significantly decreased\", \"B420 and LU + B420 also significantly reduced energy intake compared to Placebo.\"], [\"Bifidobacterium animalisssp.lactis 420\", \"Placebo\", \"Adverse events\", \"no significant difference\", \"There were no differences between groups in the incidence of adverse events.\"], [\"Litesse\\u00ae Ultra polydextrose  \\u0301+ Bifidobacterium animalisssp. lactis 420\", \"Placebo\", \"Body fat mass\", \"significantly decreased\", \"here were no significant differences between groups in body fat mass in the ITT population.

This study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of intraperitoneal instillation of high-volume low-concentration bupivacaine for post-operative analgesia in LC.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS:: Sixty patients undergoing LC were included in this prospective, double-blind, randomised study. Patients were divided into two (n = 30) groups. In Group S, intraperitoneal irrigation was done with 500 ml of normal saline. In Group B, 20 ml of 0.5% (100 mg) bupivacaine was added to 480 ml of normal saline for intraperitoneal irrigation during and after surgery. Post-operative pain was assessed by numeric pain rating scale (NRS) at fixed time intervals. Duration of analgesia (DOA), total rescue analgesic requirement (intravenous tramadol), presence of shoulder pain, nausea and vomiting were recorded for the initial 24 h post-operatively.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: Mean DOA in Group S was 0.06 ± 0.172 h (3.6 ± 10.32 min) and that in Group B was 19.35 ± 8.64 h (P = 0.000).

Rescue antiemetic was used less in the RD group without significance.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Combination of ramosetron and dexamethasone significantly reduced the incidence of moderate to severe nausea and vomiting compared to ramosetron alone in highly susceptible patients receiving opioid-based IV PCA after surgery.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[[\"5 mg of dexamethasone was injected before anesthetic induction, while at the end of the surgery, ramosetron (0.3 mg) was administered to all patients\", \"normal saline (1 ml) was injected before anesthetic induction, while at the end of the surgery, ramosetron (0.3 mg) was administered to all patients\", \"incidence of moderate to severe nausea\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The number of patients with moderate to severe nausea (20 vs. 10, P = 0.029) were significantly lower in the group RD than in the group R, respectively.\"], [\"5 mg of dexamethasone was injected before anesthetic induction, while at the end of the surgery, ramosetron (0.3 mg) was administered to all patients\", \"normal saline (1 ml) was injected before anesthetic induction, while at the end of the surgery, ramosetron (0.3 mg) was administered to all patients\", \"overall incidence of vomiting\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The number of patients with moderate to severe nausea (20 vs. 10, P = 0.029), and overall incidence of vomiting (13 vs. 5, P = 0.037) were significantly lower in the group RD than in the group R, respectively.\"]]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[[\"5 mg of dexamethasone was injected before anesthetic induction, while at the end of the surgery, ramosetron (0.3 mg) was administered to all patients\", \"normal saline (1 ml) was injected before anesthetic induction, while at the end of the surgery, ramosetron (0.3 mg) was administered to all patients\", \"incidence of moderate to severe nausea\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The number of patients with moderate to severe nausea (20 vs. 10, P = 0.029) were significantly lower in the group RD than in the group R, respectively.\"], [\"5 mg of dexamethasone was injected before anesthetic induction, while at the end of the surgery, ramosetron (0.3 mg) was administered to all patients\", \"normal saline (1 ml) was injected before anesthetic induction, while at the end of the surgery, ramosetron (0.3 mg) was administered to all patients\", \"overall incidence of vomiting\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The number of patients with moderate to severe nausea (20 vs. 10, P = 0.029), and overall incidence of vomiting (13 vs. 5, P = 0.037) were significantly lower in the group RD than in the group R, respectively.\"]]"], "doc_hash": "7935b4f27c6974ee955ad2c3f90a3681f736fef5bf15ddec3ff83a738b27e3e7", "prompt_hash": "f07ff67138f7718ed8a7eda21ea1bd1ff3b21750e88c399f89be519484a703e3", "target_hash": "a0e4fb31e100f666afdc947c7b700068369fa2fdf4983eb9daefedd3f95c51b3", "bypass": null}

Japanese patients who met the criteria were randomized to trial group and the combination diuretic group (received 7.5 mg of tolvaptan) or the conventional diuretic group (received 40 mg of furosemide) for 7 d in addition to the natriuretic drug which was used prior to enrolment in this study. The primary endpoint was the change in body weight from the baseline. Vital signs, fluid intake, and laboratory and urinary data were assessed to determine the pharmacological effects after administration of aquaretic and natriuretic drugs.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: A total of 56 patients were randomized to receive either tolvaptan (n = 28) or furosemide (n = 28). In the combination and conventional diuretic groups, the average decrease in body weight from the baseline was 3.21 ± 3.17 kg (P < 0.0001) and 1.75 ± 2.36 kg (P = 0.0006), respectively, when measured on the final dosing day.

Patients were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to one of the following groups: FOLFIRI/XELIRI plus simvastatin (40 mg) or FOLFIRI/XELIRI plus placebo. The FOLFIRI regimen consisted of irinotecan at 180 mg m−2 as a 90-min infusion, leucovorin at 200 mg m−2 as a 2-h infusion, and a bolus injection of 5-FU 400 mg m−2 followed by a 46-h continuous infusion of 5-FU at 2400 mg m−2. The XELIRI regimen consisted of irinotecan at 250 mg m−2 as a 90-min infusion with capecitabine 1000 mg m−2 twice daily for 14 days. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included response rate, duration of response, overall survival (OS), time to progression, and toxicity.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: Between April 2010 and July 2013, 269 patients were enrolled and assigned to treatment groups (134 simvastatin, 135 placebo). The median PFS was 5.9 months (95% CI, 4.5–7.3) in the XELIRI/FOLFIRI plus simvastatin group and 7.0 months (95% CI, 5.4–8.6) in the XELIRI/FOLFIRI plus placebo group (P=0.937). No significant difference was observed between the two groups with respect to OS (median, 15.9 months (simvastatin) vs 19.9 months (placebo), P=0.826).

The present intervention study evaluated the effect in subjects over 60-yr-old. The vitamin K group (vitamin K + vitamin D + calcium supplement; 15 mg of vitamin K2 [menatetrenone] three times daily, 400 IU of vitamin D once a day, and 315 mg of calcium twice daily) and the control group (vitamin D + calcium supplement) were randomly assigned. During the six months of treatment, seventy eight women participated (38 in the vitamin K group and 40 in the control group) and 45 women completed the study. The baseline characteristics of study participants did not differ between the vitamin K and the control groups. In a per protocol analysis after 6 months, L3 bone mineral density has increased statistically significantly in the vitamin K group compared to the control group (0.01 ± 0.03 g/cm2 vs -0.008 ± 0.04 g/cm2, P = 0.049). UcOC concentration was also significantly decreased in the vitamin K group (-1.6 ± 1.6 ng/dL vs -0.4 ± 1.1 ng/dL, P = 0.008).

Patients were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to one of the following groups: FOLFIRI/XELIRI plus simvastatin (40 mg) or FOLFIRI/XELIRI plus placebo. The FOLFIRI regimen consisted of irinotecan at 180 mg m−2 as a 90-min infusion, leucovorin at 200 mg m−2 as a 2-h infusion, and a bolus injection of 5-FU 400 mg m−2 followed by a 46-h continuous infusion of 5-FU at 2400 mg m−2. The XELIRI regimen consisted of irinotecan at 250 mg m−2 as a 90-min infusion with capecitabine 1000 mg m−2 twice daily for 14 days. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included response rate, duration of response, overall survival (OS), time to progression, and toxicity.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS:: Between April 2010 and July 2013, 269 patients were enrolled and assigned to treatment groups (134 simvastatin, 135 placebo). The median PFS was 5.9 months (95% CI, 4.5–7.3) in the XELIRI/FOLFIRI plus simvastatin group and 7.0 months (95% CI, 5.4–8.6) in the XELIRI/FOLFIRI plus placebo group (P=0.937). No significant difference was observed between the two groups with respect to OS (median, 15.9 months (simvastatin) vs 19.9 months (placebo), P=0.826). Grade ⩾3 nausea and anorexia were noted slightly more often in patients in the simvastatin arm compared with with the placebo arm (4.5% vs 0.7%, 3.0% vs 0%, respectively).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:: The addition of 40 mg simvastatin to the XELIRI/FOLFIRI regimens did not improve PFS in patients with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer nor did it increase toxicity.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[[\"FOLFIRI/XELIRI plus simvastatin\", \"FOLFIRI/XELIRI plus placebo\", \"progression-free survival\", \"no significant difference\", \"The median PFS was 5.9 months (95% CI, 4.5–7.3) in the XELIRI/FOLFIRI plus simvastatin group and 7.0 months (95% CI, 5.4–8.6) in the XELIRI/FOLFIRI plus placebo group (P=0.937).\"], [\"FOLFIRI/XELIRI plus simvastatin\", \"FOLFIRI/XELIRI plus placebo\", \"overall survival\", \"no significant difference\", \"No significant difference was observed between the two groups with respect to OS (median, 15.9 months (simvastatin) vs 19.9 months (placebo), P=0.826).\"], [\"FOLFIRI/XELIRI plus simvastatin\", \"FOLFIRI/XELIRI plus placebo\", \"grade ⩾3 nausea and anorexia\", \"significantly increased\", \"Grade ⩾3 nausea and anorexia were noted slightly more often in patients in the simvastatin arm compared with the placebo arm (4.5% vs 0.7%, 3.0% vs 0%, respectively).\"]]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[[\"FOLFIRI/XELIRI plus simvastatin\", \"FOLFIRI/XELIRI plus placebo\", \"progression-free survival\", \"no significant difference\", \"The median PFS was 5.9 months (95% CI, 4.5–7.3) in the XELIRI/FOLFIRI plus simvastatin group and 7.0 months (95% CI, 5.4–8.6) in the XELIRI/FOLFIRI plus placebo group (P=0.937).\"], [\"FOLFIRI/XELIRI plus simvastatin\", \"FOLFIRI/XELIRI plus placebo\", \"overall survival\", \"no significant difference\", \"No significant difference was observed between the two groups with respect to OS (median, 15.9 months (simvastatin) vs 19.9 months (placebo), P=0.826).\"], [\"FOLFIRI/XELIRI plus simvastatin\", \"FOLFIRI/XELIRI plus placebo\", \"grade ⩾3 nausea and anorexia\", \"significantly increased\", \"Grade ⩾3 nausea and anorexia were noted slightly more often in patients in the simvastatin arm compared with the placebo arm (4.5% vs 0.7%, 3.0% vs 0%, respectively).\"]]"], "doc_hash": "65c46a1c4984d10fbe4ec858075d20567de79d07593f146f18ed42cfac7db825", "prompt_hash": "4f20d9fb6f83d198dddcc6912969753b8d7c1bf2002ad157abc761e48cd1deaf", "target_hash": "b5fef017da112cd7d4b4d15cf94710d442f9b20844f96f95b42f26a681dd5a71", "bypass": null}

As new guidelines in this context, particularly for health care-associated (HCA) infections, would be needed, we performed a trial documenting whether an empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is more effective than the standard one for these infections. Because of the higher daily cost of broad-spectrum than standard antibiotics, we performed a cost analysis to compare: 1) total drug costs, 2) profitability of hospital admissions.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: This retrospective observational analysis was performed on patients enrolled in the trial NCT01820026, in which consecutive cirrhotic patients with HCA infections were randomly assigned to a standard vs a broad-spectrum treatment. Antibiotic daily doses, days of treatment, length of hospital stay, and DRG (diagnosis-related group) were recorded from the clinical trial medical records. The profitability of hospitalizations was calculated considering DRG tariffs divided by length of hospital stay.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: We considered 84 patients (42 for each group). The standard therapy allowed to obtain a first-line treatment cost lower than in the broad-spectrum therapy. Anyway, the latter, being related to a lower failure rate (19% vs 57.1%), resulted in cost saving in terms of cumulative antibiotic costs (first- and second-line treatments). The mean cost saving per patient for the broad-spectrum arm was €44.18 (−37.6%), with a total cost saving of about €2,000. Compared to standard group, we observed a statistically significant reduction in hospital stay from 17.8 to 11.8 days (p<0.002) for patients treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The distribution of DRG tariffs was similar in the two groups. According to DRG, the shorter length of hospital stay of the broad-spectrum group involved a higher mean profitable daily cost than standard group (€345.61 vs €252.23; +37%).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Our study supports the idea that the use of a broad-spectrum empirical treatment for HCA infections in cirrhosis would be cost-saving and that hospitals need to be aware of the clinical and economic consequences of a wrong antibiotic treatment in this setting.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"broad-spectrum treatment\", \"standard\", \"hospital stay\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Compared to standard group, we observed a statistically significant reduction in hospital stay from 17.8 to 11.8 days (p\\u0026lt;0.002) for patients treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.\"], [\"broad-spectrum treatment\", \"standard\", \"hospital stay\", \"significantly decreased\", \"statistically significant reduction in hospital stay from 17.8 to 11.8 days (p\\u003c0.002) for patients treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Deliberate restriction of food intake (dieting) produces short-term weight loss but is largely unsuccessful for long-term weight management. Two promising approaches for the prevention of weight gain are intuitive eating (ie, eating in accordance with hunger and satiety signals) and the development of greater psychological flexibility (ie, the aim of acceptance and commitment therapy [ACT]).\n\nABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES: This pilot study investigated the usage, acceptability, and feasibility of \"Mind, Body, Food,\" a Web-based weight gain prevention intervention prototype that teaches intuitive eating and psychological flexibility skills.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Participants were 40 overweight women (mean age 44.8 [standard deviation, SD, 3.06] years, mean body mass index [BMI] 32.9 [SD 6.01] kg/m2, mean Intuitive Eating Scale [IES-1] total score 53.4 [SD 7.46], classified as below average) who were recruited from the general population in Dunedin, New Zealand. Module completion and study site metrics were assessed using Google Analytics. Use of an online self-monitoring tool was determined by entries saved to a secure online database. Intervention acceptability was assessed postintervention. BMI, intuitive eating, binge eating, psychological flexibility, and general mental and physical health were assessed pre- and postintervention and 3-months postintervention.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Of the 40 women enrolled in the study, 12 (30%) completed all 12 modules (median 7.5 [interquartile range, IQR, 2-12] modules) and 4 (10%) used the self-monitoring tool for all 14 weeks of the intervention period (median 3 [IQR 1-9] weeks). Among 26 women who completed postintervention assessments, most women rated \"Mind, Body, Food\" as useful (20/26, 77%), easy to use (17/25, 68%) and liked the intervention (22/25, 88%). From pre- to postintervention, there were statistically significant within-group increases in intuitive eating (IES-2 total score P<.001; all IES-2 subscale scores: P ≤.01), psychological flexibility (P=.01), and general mental health (P<.001) as well as significant decreases in binge eating (P=.01). At the 3-month follow-up, IES-2 improvements were maintained, and there were further improvements in binge eating (P<.001) and general mental health (P=.03), and a marginal yet nonsignificant tendency for further improvement in psychological flexibility (P=.06). There were no significant within-group changes in BMI from pre- to postintervention and postintervention to 3-month follow-up (P=.46 and P=.93, respectively).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: The \"Mind, Body, Food\" prototype Web-based intervention is appealing to middle-aged women and may be a useful tool to help women learn intuitive eating and ACT skills, reduce binge eating, and maintain weight over 3 months. Further work to improve the user experience and engagement is required before testing the online intervention in a randomized controlled trial.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Intuitive Eating and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy\", \"Control\", \"Intuitive eating total score \", \"significantly increased\", \"From pre- to postintervention, there were statistically significant within-group increases in intuitive eating (IES-2 total score P\\u003c.001; all IES-2 subscale scores: P \\u2264.01), psychological flexibility (P=.01), and general mental health (P\\u003c.001) as well as significant decreases in binge eating (P=.01)\"], [\"Intuitive Eating and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy\", \"Control\", \"Psychological flexibility\", \"significantly increased\", \"From pre- to postintervention, there were statistically significant within-group increases in intuitive eating (IES-2 total score P\\u003c.001; all IES-2 subscale scores: P \\u2264.01), psychological flexibility (P=.01), and general mental health (P\\u003c.001) as well as significant decreases in binge eating (P=.01)\"], [\"Intuitive Eating and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy\", \"Control\", \"General mental health \", \"significantly increased\", \"From pre- to postintervention, there were statistically significant within-group increases in intuitive eating (IES-2 total score P\\u003c.001; all IES-2 subscale scores: P \\u2264.01), psychological flexibility (P=.01), and general mental health (P\\u003c.001) as well as significant decreases in binge eating (P=.01)\"], [\"Intuitive Eating and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy\", \"Control\", \"Binge eating\", \"significantly decreased\", \"From pre- to postintervention, there were statistically significant within-group increases in intuitive eating (IES-2 total score P\\u003c.001; all IES-2 subscale scores: P \\u2264.01), psychological flexibility (P=.01), and general mental health (P\\u003c.001) as well as significant decreases in binge eating (P=.01)\"], [\"Intuitive Eating and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy\", \"Control\", \"BMI\", \"no significant difference\", \"There were no significant within-group changes in BMI from pre- to postintervention and postintervention to 3-month follow-up (P=.46 and P=.93, respectively).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Patients received flexibly dosed aripiprazole (1–15 mg/day) or placebo. Ninety-two patients were randomized to placebo (n = 45) or aripiprazole (n = 47). Aripiprazole produced a significant improvement in the mean parent/caregiver-rated Aberrant Behavior Checklist Japanese Version irritability subscale score relative to placebo from week 3 through week 8. Administration of aripiprazole provided significantly greater improvement in the mean clinician-rated Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scores than placebo from week 2 through week 8. All patients randomized to aripiprazole completed the study, and no serious adverse events were reported. Three patients in placebo group discontinued. Aripiprazole was effective and generally safe and well-tolerated in the treatment of irritability associated with ASD in Japanese children and adolescents.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"aripiprazole\", \"placebo\", \"mean parent/caregiver-rated Aberrant Behavior Checklist Japanese Version irritability subscale score\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Aripiprazole produced a significant improvement in the mean parent/caregiver-rated Aberrant Behavior Checklist Japanese Version irritability subscale score relative to placebo from week 3 through week 8.\"],\n    [\"aripiprazole\", \"placebo\", \"mean clinician-rated Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scores\", \"significantly increased\", \"Administration of aripiprazole provided significantly greater improvement in the mean clinician-rated Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scores than placebo from week 2 through week 8.\"],\n    [\"aripiprazole\", null, \"patients completing the study\", \"no significant difference\", \"All patients randomized to aripiprazole completed the study, and no serious adverse events were reported.\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"aripiprazole\", \"placebo\", \"mean parent/caregiver-rated Aberrant Behavior Checklist Japanese Version irritability subscale score\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Aripiprazole produced a significant improvement in the mean parent/caregiver-rated Aberrant Behavior Checklist Japanese Version irritability subscale score relative to placebo from week 3 through week 8.\"],\n    [\"aripiprazole\", \"placebo\", \"mean clinician-rated Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scores\", \"significantly increased\", \"Administration of aripiprazole provided significantly greater improvement in the mean clinician-rated Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scores than placebo from week 2 through week 8.\"],\n    [\"aripiprazole\", null, \"patients completing the study\", \"no significant difference\", \"All patients randomized to aripiprazole completed the study, and no serious adverse events were reported.\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "96a081ba83484c304488088737bc3f73d29c12ed8335644ea188b661f30b945d", "prompt_hash": "7cd83c77b725eeb3429d7f55e37a7975e3ce9090da2547a06e68577d3d32af42", "target_hash": "4611cc87c6069957dcefcc62479500fae2ca54e95c6d7a9eee3204391a0ce562", "bypass": null}

Balance problems are well-established modifiable risk factors for falls, which are common in older adults. The objective of this study was to establish the efficacy of a Wii-Fit interactive video-game-led physical exercise program to improve balance in older Veterans. Methods. A prospective randomized controlled parallel-group trial was conducted at Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Thirty community dwelling Veterans aged 68 (±6.7) years were randomized to either the exercise or control groups. The exercise group performed Wii-Fit program while the control group performed a computer-based cognitive program for 45 minutes, three days per week for 8-weeks. The primary (Berg Balance Scale (BBS)) and secondary outcomes (fear of falling, physical activity enjoyment, and quality of life) were measured at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks. Results. Of 30 randomized subjects, 27 completed all aspects of the study protocol. There were no study-related adverse events. Intent-to-treat analysis showed a significantly greater improvement in BBS in the exercise group (6.0; 95% CI, 5.1–6.9) compared to the control group (0.5; 95% CI, −0.3–1.3) at 8 weeks (average intergroup difference (95% CI), 5.5 (4.3–6.7), p < 0.001) after adjusting for baseline.

In each patient one ovary was randomly allocated to retrieval with either a 20 G/ 35 mm (thin) or 17 G/ 35 mm (standard) needle, the other ovary was then retrieved with the opposite needle.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The standard diameter needle was used to collect a total of 215 oocytes from 355 aspirated follicles (60.6%) compared to 203 oocytes from 352 aspirated follicles (57.7%) with the thinner needle (p = 0.23). Stratifying outcomes by anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), as indicator of ovarian reserve, and by body mass index (BMI) the oocyte yields, still, did not differ (AMH, r (17) = −0.20, p = 0.44; BMI, r (17) =0.02, p = 0.96). Outcomes also did not vary among women with diminished ovarian reserve (p = 0.17) and in women with normal ovarian reserve (p = 1.00). Operating time was, however, significantly increased by 3.3 minutes per ovary (z = −3.08, p = 0.002) with the thinner needle.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Needle diameter does not affect oocyte yield, including in obese patients and patients with diminished ovarian reserve.

Evidence on the effect of non-monetary incentives on response rates in observational longitudinal research is scarce.\n\nABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES: To study the impact of two strategies to enhance completeness and efficiency in observational cohort studies with follow-up durations of around 2 years.\n\nABSTRACT.METHOD AND INTERVENTION: In a factorial design, 771 children between 2 and 5 years old and their parents participating in a prospective cohort study were randomized to three intervention groups and a control group. Three types of lotteries were run: (i) daytrip tickets for the whole family to a popular amusement park if they returned all postal questionnaires, (ii) €12.50-worth gift vouchers for sending back the questionnaire on time after each questionnaire round and (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii).\n\nABSTRACT.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was the proportion of participants who returned all questionnaires without any reminder. Secondary outcomes were '100% returned with or without reminder', 'probability of 100% non-response', 'probability of withdrawal', 'proportion of returned questionnaires' and 'overall number of reminders sent'.\n\nABSTRACT.STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: After testing for interaction between the two lottery interventions, the two trials were analysed separately. We calculated risk differences (RD) and numbers needed to \"treat\" and their 95% confidence intervals.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Daytrip nor voucher intervention had an effect on the proportion of participants who returned all questionnaires (RD −0.01; 95% CI-0.07 – 0.06) and (RD 0.02; 95% CI-0.50 – 0.08), respectively.

The patients followed both psychological and nutritional consultations in the beginning of the program. The patients participated in 24-32 sessions of physical activity three times a week, each time lasting 1-1.5 h. Each session consisted of 20 min of warming up, 20-40 min of aerobic exercises, 5 min of cooling down, and 20 min of relaxation. Physician's visit, exercise test, echocardiography, fat and blood sugar profile tests were conducted for all patients before and after the rehabilitation program. The Life Quality Form SF-36 was filled out for them and the data were analyzed using the SPSS.  <p>  Results: Our findings showed that there was a statistically significant increase in the mean score of the patients' life quality after rehabilitation. Also, the comparison of the scores of the eight aspects of patients' life quality before and after rehabilitation revealed that life quality improved in the following directions: physical functioning, limitation of physical health, limitation of psychological health, energy, social functioning, and physical pain. All differences were statistically significant yet, the difference regarding the aspects of psychological health and general well-being were not significant.  <p>  Conclusion: Cardiac rehabilitation is effective on improving the life quality of cardiac failure patients. \n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"physical activity\", \"baseline\", \"physical functioning\", \"significantly increased\", \"Our findings showed that there was a statistically significant increase in the mean score of the patients' life quality after rehabilitation.\"],\n    [\"physical activity\", \"baseline\", \"limitation of physical health\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Our findings showed that there was a statistically significant increase in the mean score of the patients' life quality after rehabilitation.\"],\n    [\"physical activity\", \"baseline\", \"limitation of psychological health\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Our findings showed that there was a statistically significant increase in the mean score of the patients' life quality after rehabilitation.\"],\n    [\"physical activity\", \"baseline\", \"energy\", \"significantly increased\", \"Our findings showed that there was a statistically significant increase in the mean score of the patients' life quality after rehabilitation.\"],\n    [\"physical activity\", \"baseline\", \"social functioning\", \"significantly increased\", \"Our findings showed that there was a statistically significant increase in the mean score of the patients' life quality after rehabilitation.\"],\n    [\"physical activity\", \"baseline\", \"physical pain\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Our findings showed that there was a statistically significant increase in the mean score of the patients' life quality after rehabilitation.\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"physical activity\", \"baseline\", \"physical functioning\", \"significantly increased\", \"Our findings showed that there was a statistically significant increase in the mean score of the patients' life quality after rehabilitation.\"],\n    [\"physical activity\", \"baseline\", \"limitation of physical health\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Our findings showed that there was a statistically significant increase in the mean score of the patients' life quality after rehabilitation.\"],\n    [\"physical activity\", \"baseline\", \"limitation of psychological health\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Our findings showed that there was a statistically significant increase in the mean score of the patients' life quality after rehabilitation.\"],\n    [\"physical activity\", \"baseline\", \"energy\", \"significantly increased\", \"Our findings showed that there was a statistically significant increase in the mean score of the patients' life quality after rehabilitation.\"],\n    [\"physical activity\", \"baseline\", \"social functioning\", \"significantly increased\", \"Our findings showed that there was a statistically significant increase in the mean score of the patients' life quality after rehabilitation.\"],\n    [\"physical activity\", \"baseline\", \"physical pain\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Our findings showed that there was a statistically significant increase in the mean score of the patients' life quality after rehabilitation.\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "c786bb1db0a1f98458a53eb3d787d6f2489c08fda0cee09b356efac4551d8708", "prompt_hash": "813cc4fd9210e58e457e27e1107c3768ab0407e36b3ab66811229b9fdfa8f7a0", "target_hash": "e3236862d003fb807a5d5ae4b014dfa9325b80ffdfa5cf2f4c19dbe59d171b7f", "bypass": null}

We designed this study to evaluate the efficiency of a traditional herbal preparation (Lax-Asab) in treating chronic constipation. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, participants with chronic constipation (n = 48) were randomly selected to receive either the Lax-Asab powder (n = 24) or placebo (n = 24) on alternative days for 4 weeks. The Lax-Asab powder contains equal amounts of Cassia angustifolia Vahl. (狹葉番瀉葉 xiá yè fān xiè yè), Mentha piperita L. (胡椒薄荷 hú jiāo bò hé), Zingiber officinale Rosc. (生薑 shēng jiāng), Glycyrrhiza glabra L. (甘草 gān cǎo). A total of 40 patients completed the study. We determined the severity of constipation based on defecation frequency (per week) and defecation difficulties. Of the total of 48 patients who participated, 40 completed the trial [24 men (60%), mean age, 21.0 ± 4.2 years; 16 women (40%), mean age, 20.1 ± 4.3 years]. The mean of weekly defecation frequency increased in both groups; from 1.8 ± 0.41 to 4.8 ± 1.12 times in patients who received Lax-Asab and from 1.7 ± 0.44 to 2.2 ± 0.61 times in patients who received placebo. A time–treatment interaction showed that this increase was significantly higher in the intervention group. Defecation difficulties improved significantly more in patients who received Lax-Asab than patients who received placebo.

Despite intensive efforts to improve the quality of life of rural and aboriginal communities in Malaysia, anaemia and IDA are still major public health problems in these communities particularly among children. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted on 250 Orang Asli (aboriginal) schoolchildren in Malaysia to investigate the effects of a single high-dose of vitamin A supplementation (200,000 IU) on iron status indices, anaemia and IDA status. The effect of the supplement was assessed after 3 months of receiving the supplements; after a complete 3-day deworming course of 400 mg/day of albendazole tablets. The prevalence of anaemia was found to be high: 48.5% (95% CI = 42.3, 54.8). Moreover, 34% (95% CI = 28.3, 40.2) of the children had IDA, which accounted for 70.1% of the anaemic cases. The findings showed that the reduction in serum ferritin level and the increments in haemoglobin, serum iron and transferrin saturation were found to be significant among children allocated to the vitamin A group compared to those allocated to the placebo group (p < 0.01). Moreover, a significant reduction in the prevalence of IDA by almost 22% than prevalence at baseline was reported among children in the vitamin A group compared with only 2.3% reduction among children in the placebo group. In conclusion, vitamin A supplementation showed a significant impact on iron status indices and IDA among Orang Asli children. Hence, providing vitamin A supplementation and imparting the knowledge related to nutritious food should be considered in the efforts to improve the nutritional and health status of these children as a part of efforts to improve the quality of life in rural and aboriginal communities.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"vitamin A group\", \"placebo group\", \"haemoglobin\", \"significantly increased\", \"The findings showed that the reduction in serum ferritin level and the increments in haemoglobin, serum iron and transferrin saturation were found to be significant among children allocated to the vitamin A group compared to those allocated to the placebo group (p \\u003c 0.01).\"], [\"vitamin A group\", \"placebo group\", \"serum ferritin level\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The findings showed that the reduction in serum ferritin level and the increments in haemoglobin, serum iron and transferrin saturation were found to be significant among children allocated to the vitamin A group compared to those allocated to the placebo group (p \\u003c 0.01).\"], [\"vitamin A group\", \"placebo group\", \"serum iron\", \"significantly increased\", \"The findings showed that the reduction in serum ferritin level and the increments in haemoglobin, serum iron and transferrin saturation were found to be significant among children allocated to the vitamin A group compared to those allocated to the placebo group (p \\u003c 0.01).\"], [\"vitamin A group\", \"placebo group\", \"transferrin saturation\", \"significantly increased\", \"The findings showed that the reduction in serum ferritin level and the increments in haemoglobin, serum iron and transferrin saturation were found to be significant among children allocated to the vitamin A group compared to those allocated to the placebo group (p \\u003c 0.01).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

This study aims to assess changes in attitudes toward patient safety culture and frequency of quality-related event (QRE) reporting after guided implementation of a continuous quality improvement (CQI) program in a panel of community pharmacies in the United States (U.S.).\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Twenty-one community pharmacies volunteered to participate in the project and were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. Pharmacy staff in the intervention group received guided training to ensure full implementation of a CQI program while those in the control group partially implemented the program. Pharmacy staff in both groups completed retrospective pre-post safety culture questionnaires and reported medication errors and near misses that occurred in their practices. Rasch analysis was applied to assess questionnaire validity and reliability and to confirm if the ordinal level data approximated interval level measures. Paired t-tests and repeated measure analysis of covariance tests were subsequently used to compare observed changes in the attitudes of subjects and frequency of QREs reporting in intervention and control groups.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Sixty-nine employees completed the questionnaire, a 43.9% response rate.

This study aims to assess changes in attitudes toward patient safety culture and frequency of quality-related event (QRE) reporting after guided implementation of a continuous quality improvement (CQI) program in a panel of community pharmacies in the United States (U.S.).\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Twenty-one community pharmacies volunteered to participate in the project and were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. Pharmacy staff in the intervention group received guided training to ensure full implementation of a CQI program while those in the control group partially implemented the program. Pharmacy staff in both groups completed retrospective pre-post safety culture questionnaires and reported medication errors and near misses that occurred in their practices. Rasch analysis was applied to assess questionnaire validity and reliability and to confirm if the ordinal level data approximated interval level measures. Paired t-tests and repeated measure analysis of covariance tests were subsequently used to compare observed changes in the attitudes of subjects and frequency of QREs reporting in intervention and control groups.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Sixty-nine employees completed the questionnaire, a 43.9% response rate. Improvement in attitudes toward patient safety was statistically significant in the intervention group in six domains: staff, training, and skill (p = 0.017); patient counseling (p = 0.043); communication about mistakes (p < 0.001); response to mistakes (p < 0.001); organizational learning – continuous improvement (p < 0.001); and overall patient safety perceptions (p = 0.033). No significant differences were observed in QRE reporting rates between intervention and control groups. However, differences were observed in the types of QREs reported (e.g., incorrect safety cap) and the point in the prescription processing workflow where a QRE was detected (e.g., partner check station, and drug utilization review station) in the intervention group (p < 0.001).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Guided CQI program implementation increased the self-reported patient safety culture attitudes among staff.\n\nABSTRACT.ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (10.1186/s40545-017-0114-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"guided training to ensure full implementation of a CQI program\", \"those in the control group partially implemented the program\", \"attitudes toward patient safety\", \"significantly increased\", \"Improvement in attitudes toward patient safety was statistically significant in the intervention group in six domains: staff, training, and skill (p = 0.017); patient counseling (p = 0.043); communication about mistakes (p < 0.001); response to mistakes (p < 0.001); organizational learning – continuous improvement (p < 0.001); and overall patient safety perceptions (p = 0.033).\"],\n    [null, null, \"frequency of QREs reporting\", \"no significant difference\", \"No significant differences were observed in QRE reporting rates between intervention and control groups.\"],\n    [null, null, \"types of QREs reported\", \"significantly increased\", \"Differences were observed in the types of QREs reported (e.g., incorrect safety cap) in the intervention group (p < 0.001).\"],\n    [null, null, \"point in the prescription processing workflow where a QRE was detected\", \"significantly increased\", \"Differences were observed in the point in the prescription processing workflow where a QRE was detected (e.g., partner check station, and drug utilization review station) in the intervention group (p < 0.001).\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"guided training to ensure full implementation of a CQI program\", \"those in the control group partially implemented the program\", \"attitudes toward patient safety\", \"significantly increased\", \"Improvement in attitudes toward patient safety was statistically significant in the intervention group in six domains: staff, training, and skill (p = 0.017); patient counseling (p = 0.043); communication about mistakes (p < 0.001); response to mistakes (p < 0.001); organizational learning – continuous improvement (p < 0.001); and overall patient safety perceptions (p = 0.033).\"],\n    [null, null, \"frequency of QREs reporting\", \"no significant difference\", \"No significant differences were observed in QRE reporting rates between intervention and control groups.\"],\n    [null, null, \"types of QREs reported\", \"significantly increased\", \"Differences were observed in the types of QREs reported (e.g., incorrect safety cap) in the intervention group (p < 0.001).\"],\n    [null, null, \"point in the prescription processing workflow where a QRE was detected\", \"significantly increased\", \"Differences were observed in the point in the prescription processing workflow where a QRE was detected (e.g., partner check station, and drug utilization review station) in the intervention group (p < 0.001).\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "c2dec39e308b81e4a0b026eaf8e85d496e04cc86b32c6f4d22b0eaccacf74cc7", "prompt_hash": "b5ba85c052ce699fc4d56150bbd7959886fbb3c28ea86e4f69f375e22bac9659", "target_hash": "f80f82059f3e61ee5806c173d00352e626d5722ade7e9abde6935938e1f54aa1", "bypass": null}

A recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated the efficacy of alvimopan in reducing postoperative ileus and length of stay in cystectomy; however, a major limitation was the exclusion of epidural analgesia.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty–six cystectomy and urinary diversion procedures performed by seven surgeons were analyzed between January 2008 and April 2012. The first 50 patients did not receive alvimopan perioperatively, while the subsequent 36 received a single dose of 12 mg preoperatively and then 12 mg every 12 hours for 15 doses or until discharge.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The groups were equal with respect to age, gender, indication, surgeon, and type of diversion. Patients who received alvimopan experienced a shorter length of stay (LOS) versus those in who did not receive alvimopan (10.5 vs. 8.6 days, p = 0.005, 95% CI 0.6–3.3). Readmission for ileus was low in both alvimopan and control groups (0% and 4.4%, respectively). Costs were significantly lower in the alvimopan group than the control groups (2012 USD 32,443 vs. 40,604 p <0.001). This difference stood up to multivariate analysis with a $7,062 difference in hospital stay.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Use of alvimopan in the routine perioperative care of our cystectomy and urinary diversion patients has decreased LOS by 1.9 days. Additionally, institution of routine perioperative alvimopan has reduced costs by $7,062 per admission (20% reduction). This demonstrates a real world application of alvimopan at a moderate volume center.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"alvimopan\", \"control\", \"Costs\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Costs were significantly lower in the alvimopan group than the control groups (2012 USD 32,443 vs. 40,604 p \\u003c0.001).\"], [\"alvimopan\", \"control\", \"length of stay (LOS)\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Patients who received alvimopan experienced a shorter length of stay (LOS) versus those in who did not receive alvimopan (10.5 vs. 8.6 days, p = 0.005, 95% CI 0.6\\u20133.3).\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Recommendations for prehypertension include engaging in regular physical activity. We aimed to assess feasibility and acceptability and collect preliminary outcome data on ChiRunning for people with elevated blood pressure. ChiRunning is a commercially available running program based on the mindful movements of Tai Chi, which is aimed at decreasing injury by both increasing body awareness and modifying running form.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: We enrolled adults with elevated systolic (130–150 mmHg) or diastolic (80–100 mmHg) blood pressure in a 12-week pilot trial. Participants were randomized 2:1:1 to 8 weeks of: 1) intervention—a trainer-led ChiRunning group (n = 10); 2) active control—a trainer-led running group (n = 6); or 3) educational control—a self-directed running group (n = 6) and followed for 4 more weeks. The active control and educational control groups were combined for analysis.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: This study was feasible, meeting recruitment, retention and adherence goals, and acceptable to participants. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly over the study for either the ChiRunning or control groups. Changes in BMI over time were significantly different from zero in the ChiRunning group (p = 0.04) but not in the control group (slope for ChiRunning −0.05 [−0.1 to −0.002] vs. control −0.01 [−0.06 to 0.04], between slope difference, p = 0.22). Self-reported running-related injury (i.e. discomfort leading to a decrease in running) was similar between groups (ChiRunning, 4 [1.2 to 8.4] vs. control, 3 [0.7 to 7.1] injuries per 100 h of running, p = 0.72) although self-reported running-related discomfort (i.e. discomfort that does not lead to changes in running) trended higher in the ChiRunning group (ChiRunning, 10 [5.4 to 16.8] vs. control, 4 [1.5 to 9] reports of discomfort per 100 h of running, p = 0.06).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: ChiRunning appears to be a feasible and acceptable exercise program for people with elevated blood pressure. We did not find that ChiRunning had a significant impact on blood pressure or self reported injury, but did see a positive change in BMI over time. ChiRunning warrants further investigation in a larger trial.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01587183\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"Chi running program\", \"Control\", \"Systolic blood pressure \", \"no significant difference\", \"Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly over the study for either the ChiRunning or control groups.\"], [\"Chi running program\", \"Standard running program\", \"Diastolic blood pressure \", \"no significant difference\", \"Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly over the study for either the ChiRunning or control groups.\"], [\"Chi running program\", \"Standard running program\", \"Body mass index\", \"no significant difference\", \"Changes in BMI over time were significantly different from zero in the ChiRunning group (p = 0.04) but not in the control group (slope for ChiRunning \\u22120.05 [\\u22120.1 to \\u22120.002] vs. control \\u22120.01 [\\u22120.06 to 0.04], between slope difference, p = 0.22).\"], [\"Chi running program\", \"Standard running program\", \"Injury incidence \", \"no significant difference\", \"Self-reported running-related injury (i.e. discomfort leading to a decrease in running) was similar between groups (ChiRunning, 4 [1.2 to 8.4] vs. control, 3 [0.7 to 7.1] injuries per 100 h of running, p = 0.72)\"], [\"Chi running program\", \"Standard running program\", \"Systolic blood pressure \", \"no significant difference\", \"Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly over the study for either the ChiRunning or control groups.\"], [\"Chi running program\", \"Control\", \"Diastolic blood pressure \", \"no significant difference\", \"Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly over the study for either the ChiRunning or control groups.\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:90"}, "target": "[[\"Chi running program\", \"Control\", \"Systolic blood pressure \", \"no significant difference\", \"Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly over the study for either the ChiRunning or control groups.\"], [\"Chi running program\", \"Standard running program\", \"Diastolic blood pressure \", \"no significant difference\", \"Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly over the study for either the ChiRunning or control groups.\"], [\"Chi running program\", \"Standard running program\", \"Body mass index\", \"no significant difference\", \"Changes in BMI over time were significantly different from zero in the ChiRunning group (p = 0.04) but not in the control group (slope for ChiRunning \\u22120.05 [\\u22120.1 to \\u22120.002] vs. control \\u22120.01 [\\u22120.06 to 0.04], between slope difference, p = 0.22).\"], [\"Chi running program\", \"Standard running program\", \"Injury incidence \", \"no significant difference\", \"Self-reported running-related injury (i.e. discomfort leading to a decrease in running) was similar between groups (ChiRunning, 4 [1.2 to 8.4] vs. control, 3 [0.7 to 7.1] injuries per 100 h of running, p = 0.72)\"], [\"Chi running program\", \"Standard running program\", \"Systolic blood pressure \", \"no significant difference\", \"Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly over the study for either the ChiRunning or control groups.\"], [\"Chi running program\", \"Control\", \"Diastolic blood pressure \", \"no significant difference\", \"Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly over the study for either the ChiRunning or control groups.\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

This pilot study examined the effect of menu labeling with caloric information and exercise equivalents (EE) on food selection. Participants, 62 females, ages 18-34, recruited for this study, ordered a fast food meal with menus that contained the names of the food (Lunch 1 (L1), control meal). One week later (Lunch 2 (L2), experiment meal), participants ordered a meal from one of three menus with the same items as the previous week: no calorie information, calorie information only, or calorie information and EE.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: There were no absolute differences between groups in calories ordered from L1 to L2. However, it is noteworthy that calorie only and calorie plus exercise equivalents ordered about 16% (206 kcal) and 14% (162 kcal) fewer calories from Lunch 1 to Lunch 2, respectively; whereas, the no information group ordered only 2% (25 kcal) fewer.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Menu labeling alone may be insufficient to reduce calories; however, further research is needed in finding the most effective ways of presenting the menu labels for general public.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Lunch 2 (L2), experiment meal\", \"Lunch 1 (L1), control meal\", \"amount of calories\", \"no significant difference\", \"There were no absolute differences between groups in calories ordered from L1 to L2.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Despite intensive efforts to improve the quality of life of rural and aboriginal communities in Malaysia, anaemia and IDA are still major public health problems in these communities particularly among children. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted on 250 Orang Asli (aboriginal) schoolchildren in Malaysia to investigate the effects of a single high-dose of vitamin A supplementation (200,000 IU) on iron status indices, anaemia and IDA status. The effect of the supplement was assessed after 3 months of receiving the supplements; after a complete 3-day deworming course of 400 mg/day of albendazole tablets. The prevalence of anaemia was found to be high: 48.5% (95% CI = 42.3, 54.8). Moreover, 34% (95% CI = 28.3, 40.2) of the children had IDA, which accounted for 70.1% of the anaemic cases. The findings showed that the reduction in serum ferritin level and the increments in haemoglobin, serum iron and transferrin saturation were found to be significant among children allocated to the vitamin A group compared to those allocated to the placebo group (p < 0.01). Moreover, a significant reduction in the prevalence of IDA by almost 22% than prevalence at baseline was reported among children in the vitamin A group compared with only 2.3% reduction among children in the placebo group. In conclusion, vitamin A supplementation showed a significant impact on iron status indices and IDA among Orang Asli children. Hence, providing vitamin A supplementation and imparting the knowledge related to nutritious food should be considered in the efforts to improve the nutritional and health status of these children as a part of efforts to improve the quality of life in rural and aboriginal communities.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"vitamin A group\", \"placebo group\", \"haemoglobin\", \"significantly increased\", \"The findings showed that the reduction in serum ferritin level and the increments in haemoglobin, serum iron and transferrin saturation were found to be significant among children allocated to the vitamin A group compared to those allocated to the placebo group (p \\u003c 0.01).\"], [\"vitamin A group\", \"placebo group\", \"serum ferritin level\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The findings showed that the reduction in serum ferritin level and the increments in haemoglobin, serum iron and transferrin saturation were found to be significant among children allocated to the vitamin A group compared to those allocated to the placebo group (p \\u003c 0.01).\"], [\"vitamin A group\", \"placebo group\", \"serum iron\", \"significantly increased\", \"The findings showed that the reduction in serum ferritin level and the increments in haemoglobin, serum iron and transferrin saturation were found to be significant among children allocated to the vitamin A group compared to those allocated to the placebo group (p \\u003c 0.01).\"], [\"vitamin A group\", \"placebo group\", \"transferrin saturation\", \"significantly increased\", \"The findings showed that the reduction in serum ferritin level and the increments in haemoglobin, serum iron and transferrin saturation were found to be significant among children allocated to the vitamin A group compared to those allocated to the placebo group (p \\u003c 0.01).\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:91"}, "target": "[[\"vitamin A group\", \"placebo group\", \"haemoglobin\", \"significantly increased\", \"The findings showed that the reduction in serum ferritin level and the increments in haemoglobin, serum iron and transferrin saturation were found to be significant among children allocated to the vitamin A group compared to those allocated to the placebo group (p \\u003c 0.01).\"], [\"vitamin A group\", \"placebo group\", \"serum ferritin level\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The findings showed that the reduction in serum ferritin level and the increments in haemoglobin, serum iron and transferrin saturation were found to be significant among children allocated to the vitamin A group compared to those allocated to the placebo group (p \\u003c 0.01).\"], [\"vitamin A group\", \"placebo group\", \"serum iron\", \"significantly increased\", \"The findings showed that the reduction in serum ferritin level and the increments in haemoglobin, serum iron and transferrin saturation were found to be significant among children allocated to the vitamin A group compared to those allocated to the placebo group (p \\u003c 0.01).\"], [\"vitamin A group\", \"placebo group\", \"transferrin saturation\", \"significantly increased\", \"The findings showed that the reduction in serum ferritin level and the increments in haemoglobin, serum iron and transferrin saturation were found to be significant among children allocated to the vitamin A group compared to those allocated to the placebo group (p \\u003c 0.01).\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

Comprehensive eye examination and binocular vision assessment was carried out for 94 children (mean (SD) age: 15 (2.2) years) diagnosed with specific learning disorder. BV assessment was done for children with best corrected visual acuity of ≥6/9 – N6, cooperative for examination and free from any ocular pathology. For children with a diagnosis of NSBVA (n = 46), 24 children were randomized to VT and no intervention was provided to the other 22 children who served as experimental controls. At the end of 10 sessions of vision therapy, BV assessment was performed for both the intervention and non-intervention groups.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Binocular vision anomalies were found in 59 children (62.8%) among which 22% (n = 13) had strabismic binocular vision anomalies (SBVA) and 78% (n = 46) had a NSBVA. Accommodative infacility (AIF) was the commonest of the NSBVA and found in 67%, followed by convergence insufficiency (CI) in 25%. Post-vision therapy, the intervention group showed significant improvement in all the BV parameters (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p < 0.05) except negative fusional vergence.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Children with specific learning disorders have a high frequency of binocular vision disorders and vision therapy plays a significant role in improving the BV parameters. Children with SLD should be screened for BV anomalies as it could potentially be an added hindrance to the reading difficulty in this special population.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"vision therapy (VT)\", \"no intervention\", \"binocular vision (BV)\", \"significantly increased\", \"Post-vision therapy, the intervention group showed significant improvement in all the BV parameters (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p\\u0026nbsp;\\u0026lt;\\u0026nbsp;0.05) except negative fusional vergence.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

Despite intensive efforts to improve the quality of life of rural and aboriginal communities in Malaysia, anaemia and IDA are still major public health problems in these communities particularly among children. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted on 250 Orang Asli (aboriginal) schoolchildren in Malaysia to investigate the effects of a single high-dose of vitamin A supplementation (200,000 IU) on iron status indices, anaemia and IDA status. The effect of the supplement was assessed after 3 months of receiving the supplements; after a complete 3-day deworming course of 400 mg/day of albendazole tablets. The prevalence of anaemia was found to be high: 48.5% (95% CI = 42.3, 54.8). Moreover, 34% (95% CI = 28.3, 40.2) of the children had IDA, which accounted for 70.1% of the anaemic cases. The findings showed that the reduction in serum ferritin level and the increments in haemoglobin, serum iron and transferrin saturation were found to be significant among children allocated to the vitamin A group compared to those allocated to the placebo group (p < 0.01). Moreover, a significant reduction in the prevalence of IDA by almost 22% than prevalence at baseline was reported among children in the vitamin A group compared with only 2.3% reduction among children in the placebo group. In conclusion, vitamin A supplementation showed a significant impact on iron status indices and IDA among Orang Asli children. Hence, providing vitamin A supplementation and imparting the knowledge related to nutritious food should be considered in the efforts to improve the nutritional and health status of these children as a part of efforts to improve the quality of life in rural and aboriginal communities.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"single high-dose of vitamin A supplementation (200,000 IU)\", \"placebo\", \"serum ferritin level\", \"significantly increased\", \"the reduction in serum ferritin level and the increments in haemoglobin, serum iron and transferrin saturation were found to be significant among children allocated to the vitamin A group compared to those allocated to the placebo group (p < 0.01).\"],\n    [\"single high-dose of vitamin A supplementation (200,000 IU)\", \"placebo\", \"haemoglobin\", \"significantly increased\", \"the reduction in serum ferritin level and the increments in haemoglobin, serum iron and transferrin saturation were found to be significant among children allocated to the vitamin A group compared to those allocated to the placebo group (p < 0.01).\"],\n    [\"single high-dose of vitamin A supplementation (200,000 IU)\", \"placebo\", \"serum iron\", \"significantly increased\", \"the reduction in serum ferritin level and the increments in haemoglobin, serum iron and transferrin saturation were found to be significant among children allocated to the vitamin A group compared to those allocated to the placebo group (p < 0.01).\"],\n    [\"single high-dose of vitamin A supplementation (200,000 IU)\", \"placebo\", \"prevalence of IDA\", \"significantly decreased\", \"a significant reduction in the prevalence of IDA by almost 22% than prevalence at baseline was reported among children in the vitamin A group compared with only 2.3% reduction among children in the placebo group.\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"single high-dose of vitamin A supplementation (200,000 IU)\", \"placebo\", \"serum ferritin level\", \"significantly increased\", \"the reduction in serum ferritin level and the increments in haemoglobin, serum iron and transferrin saturation were found to be significant among children allocated to the vitamin A group compared to those allocated to the placebo group (p < 0.01).\"],\n    [\"single high-dose of vitamin A supplementation (200,000 IU)\", \"placebo\", \"haemoglobin\", \"significantly increased\", \"the reduction in serum ferritin level and the increments in haemoglobin, serum iron and transferrin saturation were found to be significant among children allocated to the vitamin A group compared to those allocated to the placebo group (p < 0.01).\"],\n    [\"single high-dose of vitamin A supplementation (200,000 IU)\", \"placebo\", \"serum iron\", \"significantly increased\", \"the reduction in serum ferritin level and the increments in haemoglobin, serum iron and transferrin saturation were found to be significant among children allocated to the vitamin A group compared to those allocated to the placebo group (p < 0.01).\"],\n    [\"single high-dose of vitamin A supplementation (200,000 IU)\", \"placebo\", \"prevalence of IDA\", \"significantly decreased\", \"a significant reduction in the prevalence of IDA by almost 22% than prevalence at baseline was reported among children in the vitamin A group compared with only 2.3% reduction among children in the placebo group.\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "d53a86c76a2b51295a3cfe4b532f775e8fcf396e3478c1e27dd51382acc9d26a", "prompt_hash": "f7fbc26cfae404af029f98fcd5e3ac6c07590f4d992144b2c49bd76ffe570ede", "target_hash": "b652eb8c1b76d8bd36881024fa96f0292c2220439b3f583862508d109092b108", "bypass": null}

This study examined whether the adverse effects of ketamine on oculomotor performance can be reversed by the atypical antipsychotic risperidone. In this randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 72 healthy participants performed smooth pursuit eye movements (SPEM), prosaccades (PS) and antisaccades (AS) while being randomly assigned to one of four drug groups (intravenous 100 ng ml−1 ketamine, 2 mg oral risperidone, 100 ng ml−1 ketamine plus 2 mg oral risperidone, placebo). Drug administration did not lead to harmful adverse events. Ketamine increased saccadic frequency and decreased velocity gain of SPEM (all P<0.01) but had no significant effects on PS or AS (all P⩾0.07). An effect of risperidone was observed for amplitude gain and peak velocity of PS and AS, indicating hypometric gain and slower velocities compared with placebo (both P⩽0.04). No ketamine by risperidone interactions were found (all P⩾0.26). The results confirm that the administration of ketamine produces oculomotor performance deficits similar in part to those seen in schizophrenia. The atypical antipsychotic risperidone did not reverse ketamine-induced deteriorations. These findings do not support the cognitive enhancing potential of risperidone on oculomotor biomarkers in this model system of schizophrenia and point towards the importance of developing alternative performance-enhancing compounds to optimise pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"Ketamine \", \"Placebo\", \"Smooth pursuit saccadic frequency\", \"significantly increased\", \"Ketamine increased saccadic frequency and decreased velocity gain of SPEM (all P\\u003c0.01) but had no significant effects on PS or AS (all P\\u2a7e0.07).\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:92"}, "target": "[[\"Ketamine \", \"Placebo\", \"Smooth pursuit saccadic frequency\", \"significantly increased\", \"Ketamine increased saccadic frequency and decreased velocity gain of SPEM (all P\\u003c0.01) but had no significant effects on PS or AS (all P\\u2a7e0.07).\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

The purpose of present study was to determine the effect of acute and 14-day Coenzyme Q10\nsupplementation on inflammatory, blood lactate and muscle damage in male middle-distance runners.\n <p> \nMethods: Eighteen male middle-distance runners in a randomized and quasi experimental study\nwere allocated into two equal groups: supplement group (n=9, Coenzyme Q10: 5mg/kg/day) and\nplacebo group (n= 9, Dextrose: 5mg/kg/day). After acute (1day) and 14-day supplementation, all\nsubjects were participated in a training like running (competitive 3000 meters). Blood samples were\nobtained in the four phases: one hour before and 18-24 hours after two running protocols. Lactate,\nserum interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), C-reactive protein (CRP) and\ncreatine kinase (CK) were analyzed. Repeated ANOVA and Bonferuni as a post hoc tests were used\nto determine the changes in four stages. Differences between groups were determined by t-test.\n <p> \nResults: The results showed that acute and short-term Coenzyme Q10 supplementation had not\nsignificant effect on basal parameters.

This difference was entirely attributable to a difference between the two measures during the nocturnal period. Nocturnal gastric acid breakthrough was not a useful predictor of pathologic nocturnal esophageal reflux.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: In GERD subjects treated with a PPI, measuring time esophageal pH < 4 will significantly overestimate the prevalence of pathologic esophageal acid exposure over 24 hours and during the nocturnal period.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"integrated acidity\", \"time pH \\u003c 4\", \"the prevalence of pathologic 24-hour esophageal reflux\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The prevalence of pathologic 24-hour esophageal reflux in both studies was significantly higher when measured as time pH \\u003c 4 than when measured as integrated acidity\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

The purpose of present study was to determine the effect of acute and 14-day Coenzyme Q10\nsupplementation on inflammatory, blood lactate and muscle damage in male middle-distance runners.\n <p> \nMethods: Eighteen male middle-distance runners in a randomized and quasi experimental study\nwere allocated into two equal groups: supplement group (n=9, Coenzyme Q10: 5mg/kg/day) and\nplacebo group (n= 9, Dextrose: 5mg/kg/day). After acute (1day) and 14-day supplementation, all\nsubjects were participated in a training like running (competitive 3000 meters). Blood samples were\nobtained in the four phases: one hour before and 18-24 hours after two running protocols. Lactate,\nserum interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), C-reactive protein (CRP) and\ncreatine kinase (CK) were analyzed. Repeated ANOVA and Bonferuni as a post hoc tests were used\nto determine the changes in four stages. Differences between groups were determined by t-test.\n <p> \nResults: The results showed that acute and short-term Coenzyme Q10 supplementation had not\nsignificant effect on basal parameters. The acute coenzyme Q10 supplementation attenuated only the\nexercise-induced increase in response of the plasma CRP. The short-term (14-day) coenzyme Q10\nsupplementation attenuated the exercise-induced increase in response of the lactate, serum interleukin-\n6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and CRP in male middle-distance runners. However, the acute\nand short-term coenzyme Q10 supplementation had not any significant effect on the exerciseinduced\nincrease response of total serum creatine kinase.\n <p> \nConclusion: Based on the present results, it can be concluded that the 14-day coenzyme Q10 supplementation\n(5mg.kg-1.day-1) is more effective than the acute supplementation to overcome the\nexercise-induced adverse responses in some oxidative, inflammatory and biochemical parameters.\nTherefore, short-term coenzyme Q10 supplementation is recommended to reduce exercise-induced\nadverse consequences.\n\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"acute and short-term Coenzyme Q10 supplementation\", \"placebo\", \"exercise-induced increase in response of the plasma CRP\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The acute coenzyme Q10 supplementation attenuated only the exercise-induced increase in response of the plasma CRP.\"],\n    [\"short-term Coenzyme Q10 supplementation\", \"placebo\", \"exercise-induced increase in response of the lactate\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The short-term coenzyme Q10 supplementation attenuated the exercise-induced increase in response of the lactate, serum interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and CRP in male middle-distance runners.\"],\n    [\"short-term Coenzyme Q10 supplementation\", \"placebo\", \"exercise-induced increase response of total serum creatine kinase\", \"no significant difference\", \"the acute and short-term coenzyme Q10 supplementation had not any significant effect on the exercise-induced increase response of total serum creatine kinase.\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"acute and short-term Coenzyme Q10 supplementation\", \"placebo\", \"exercise-induced increase in response of the plasma CRP\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The acute coenzyme Q10 supplementation attenuated only the exercise-induced increase in response of the plasma CRP.\"],\n    [\"short-term Coenzyme Q10 supplementation\", \"placebo\", \"exercise-induced increase in response of the lactate\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The short-term coenzyme Q10 supplementation attenuated the exercise-induced increase in response of the lactate, serum interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and CRP in male middle-distance runners.\"],\n    [\"short-term Coenzyme Q10 supplementation\", \"placebo\", \"exercise-induced increase response of total serum creatine kinase\", \"no significant difference\", \"the acute and short-term coenzyme Q10 supplementation had not any significant effect on the exercise-induced increase response of total serum creatine kinase.\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "882c2a72f923b7b01935b2c1dfe65450d46837613c3f336345d07bdaf3a86389", "prompt_hash": "d99d65749ba48d28fc3a8d6c434ed2ea86cc84d2cd25effbad8b8fb7fdd9cd25", "target_hash": "76a589b79106aaa8cb0c195ae75b17218f6335e128654752fad6406142b2ada0", "bypass": null}

As monotherapy in patients with CLL, it has no clinical activity. Here we report the results of an open-label, randomized phase II trial comparing the combination of pentostatin, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (PCR) either without or with bevacizumab (PCR-B) in previously untreated CLL patients. A total of 65 evaluable patients were enrolled, 32 receiving PCR and 33 PCR-B. A higher rate of grade 3-4 cardiovascular toxicity was observed with PCR-B (33% vs. 3%, p < 0.003). Patients treated with PCR-B had a trend for a higher complete remission (CR) rate (54.5% vs 31.3%; p = 0.08), longer progression-free survival (PFS)(p = 0.06) and treatment-free survival (TFS)(p = 0.09). No differences in PFS and TFS by IGHV mutational status were observed with the addition of bevacizumab. A significant post-treatment increase in VEGF levels was observed in the PCR-B arm (29.77 to 57.05 pg/mL); in the PCR-B arm, lower baseline CCL-3 levels were significantly associated with achievement of CR (p = 0.01). In conclusion, the addition of bevacizumab to chemoimmunotherapy in CLL is generally well-tolerated and appears to prolong PFS and TFS.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"chemoimmunotherapy with bevacizumab (PCR-B)\", \"chemoimmunotherapy without bevacizumab (PCR)\", \"post-treatment vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels\", \"significantly increased\", \"A significant post-treatment increase in VEGF levels was observed in the PCR-B arm (29.77 to 57.05 pg/mL);\"], [\"chemoimmunotherapy with bevacizumab (PCR-B)\", \"chemoimmunotherapy without bevacizumab (PCR)\", \"treatment-free survival (TFS)\", \"no significant difference\", \"Patients treated with PCR-B had a trend for a higher complete remission (CR) rate (54.5% vs 31.3%;

Its therapeutic approach is challenging as the first line treatment often does not help, or even causes intolerable side effects. The aim of our randomized double blind, placebo controlled, crossover study was to investigate in a prospective way the effect of lidocaine in patients with trigeminal neuralgia. Twenty patients met our inclusion criteria and completed the study. Each patient underwent four weekly sessions, two of which were with lidocaine (5 mgs/kg) and two with placebo infusions administered over 60 minutes. Intravenous lidocaine was superior regarding the reduction of the intensity of pain, the allodynia, and the hyperalgesia compared to placebo. Moreover, contrary to placebo, lidocaine managed to maintain its therapeutic results for the first 24 hours after intravenous infusion. Although, intravenous lidocaine is not a first line treatment, when first line medications fail to help, pain specialists may try it as an add-on treatment. This trial is registered with NCT01955967.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"lidocaine (5 mgs/kg)\", \"placebo\", \"intensity of pain\", \"significantly decreased\", \"ntravenous lidocaine was superior regarding the reduction of the intensity of pain, the allodynia, and the hyperalgesia compared to placebo.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

MATERIAL AND METHODS :  The mesial canals of 40 mandibular first molars (with curvature angles between 25° and 35°) were selected for this study. The specimens were divided randomly into 4 groups with 10 canals each. Glide paths were created in group 1 with #10, #15 and #20 K-type (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) stainless steel manual files; in group 2 with Path-File (Dentsply Maillefer) #1, #2, and #3 and in group 3 with #16 ProGlider (Dentsply Maillefer) rotary instruments; in group 4 no glide paths were created. All canals were instrumented up to ProTaper Next X2 to the working length. A double digital radiograph technique was used, pre and post-instrumentation, to assess whether apical transportation and/or aberration in root canal morphology occurred. Instrument failures were also recorded. The data were analyzed statistically using ANOVA and Tukey tests (p<0.05).\n\nABSTRACT. RESULTS :  No significant differences were found among groups regarding apical transportation (p>0.05). Two ProTaper Next instruments failed in-group 4.\n\nABSTRACT.

To assess the impact of brief smoking on the vasculature, we determined levels of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and circulating microparticles (MPs) following the smoking of one cigarette by young, healthy intermittent smokers.\n\nABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS: 12 healthy volunteers were randomized to either smoking or not smoking in a crossover fashion. Blood sampling was performed at baseline, 1, 4 and 24 hours following smoking/not smoking. The numbers of EPCs and MPs were determined by flow cytometry. MPs were measured from platelets, leukocytes and endothelial cells. Moreover, MPs were also labelled with anti-HMGB1 and SYTO 13 to assess the content of nuclear molecules.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Active smoking of one cigarette caused an immediate and significant increase in the numbers of circulating EPCs and MPs of platelet-, endothelial- and leukocyte origin. Levels of MPs containing nuclear molecules were increased, of which the majority were positive for CD41 and CD45 (platelet- and leukocyte origin). CD144 (VE-cadherin) or HMGB1 release did not significantly change during active smoking.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: Brief active smoking of one cigarette generated an acute release of EPC and MPs, of which the latter contained nuclear matter. Together, these results demonstrate acute effects of cigarette smoke on endothelial, platelet and leukocyte function as well as injury to the vascular wall.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Smoking group\", \"Control\", \"Lactadherin+ CD144+\", \"no significant difference\", \"CD144 (VE-cadherin) or HMGB1 release did not significantly change during active smoking\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

The treatment of choice is nonsedating antihistamines, dosages of which may be increased up to fourfold if standard doses are ineffective. Here, we assess the effects of a standard 20 mg dose and up-dosing to 40 and 80 mg of bilastine in reducing the symptoms of CCU and inflammatory mediator release following cold challenge.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Twenty patients with CCU were included in this randomized, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week study. They received placebo, 20, 40 or 80 mg of bilastine daily each for 7 days with 14-day washout periods. The primary readout was change in critical temperature thresholds (CTT). Secondary readouts were changes in pruritus, levels of histamine IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α collected by skin microdialysis and safety and tolerability of bilastine.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Bilastine 20 mg was highly effective (P < 0.0001) in reducing CTT. Up-dosing to 80 mg significantly (P < 0.04) increased its effectiveness. At this dose, 19 of 20 (95%) patients responded to treatment, with 12 of 20 (60%) becoming symptom free. Only one patient was refractory to treatment. Microdialysis levels of histamine, IL-6 and IL-8 assessed 1–3 h after cold challenge were significantly (P < 0.05) decreased following up-dosing with 80 mg bilastine. Bilastine treat-ment was well tolerated without evidence of increased sedation with dose escala-tion.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Bilastine was effective in reducing the symptoms of patients with CCU.

Antenatal care has the potential to reduce maternal morbidity and improve newborns' survival but this benefit may not be realized in sub-Saharan Africa where the attendance and quality of care is declining. We evaluated the association between a mobile phone intervention and antenatal care in a resource-limited setting. We aimed to assess antenatal care in a comprehensive way taking into consideration utilisation of antenatal care as well as content and timing of interventions during pregnancy.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: This study was an open label pragmatic cluster-randomised controlled trial with primary healthcare facilities in Zanzibar as the unit of randomisation. 2550 pregnant women (1311 interventions and 1239 controls) who attended antenatal care at selected primary healthcare facilities were included at their first antenatal care visit and followed until 42 days after delivery. 24 primary health care facilities in six districts were randomized to either mobile phone intervention or standard care. The intervention consisted of a mobile phone text-message and voucher component. Primary outcome measure was four or more antenatal care visits during pregnancy. Secondary outcome measures were tetanus vaccination, preventive treatment for malaria, gestational age at last antenatal care visit, and antepartum referral.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: The mobile phone intervention was associated with an increase in antenatal care attendance. In the intervention group 44% of the women received four or more antenatal care visits versus 31% in the control group (OR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.03-5.55). There was a trend towards improved timing and quality of antenatal care services across all secondary outcome measures although not statistically significant.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: The wired mothers' mobile phone intervention significantly increased the proportion of women receiving the recommended four antenatal care visits during pregnancy and there was a trend towards improved quality of care with more women receiving preventive health services, more women attending antenatal care late in pregnancy and more women with antepartum complications identified and referred. Mobile phone applications may contribute towards improved maternal and newborn health and should be considered by policy makers in resource-limited settings.\n\nABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01821222.\n\nFindings:\n[[\"Mobile phone intervention\", \"Standard care\", \"Receiving \\u2265 4 antenatal care visits\", \"significantly increased\", \"The mobile phone intervention was associated with an increase in antenatal care attendance.

The treatment of choice is nonsedating antihistamines, dosages of which may be increased up to fourfold if standard doses are ineffective. Here, we assess the effects of a standard 20 mg dose and up-dosing to 40 and 80 mg of bilastine in reducing the symptoms of CCU and inflammatory mediator release following cold challenge.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: Twenty patients with CCU were included in this randomized, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week study. They received placebo, 20, 40 or 80 mg of bilastine daily each for 7 days with 14-day washout periods. The primary readout was change in critical temperature thresholds (CTT). Secondary readouts were changes in pruritus, levels of histamine IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α collected by skin microdialysis and safety and tolerability of bilastine.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: Bilastine 20 mg was highly effective (P < 0.0001) in reducing CTT. Up-dosing to 80 mg significantly (P < 0.04) increased its effectiveness. At this dose, 19 of 20 (95%) patients responded to treatment, with 12 of 20 (60%) becoming symptom free. Only one patient was refractory to treatment. Microdialysis levels of histamine, IL-6 and IL-8 assessed 1–3 h after cold challenge were significantly (P < 0.05) decreased following up-dosing with 80 mg bilastine. Bilastine treat-ment was well tolerated without evidence of increased sedation with dose escala-tion.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: Bilastine was effective in reducing the symptoms of patients with CCU. Increased efficacy of bilastine with fourfold up-dosing was without sedation and supports urticaria treatment guidelines.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[\n    [\"bilastine 20 mg\", \"placebo\", \"change in critical temperature thresholds (CTT)\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Bilastine 20 mg was highly effective (P < 0.0001) in reducing CTT.\"],\n    [\"bilastine 80 mg\", \"bilastine 20 mg\", \"change in critical temperature thresholds (CTT)\", \"significantly increased\", \"Up-dosing to 80 mg significantly (P < 0.04) increased its effectiveness.\"],\n    [\"bilastine 80 mg\", \"placebo\", \"levels of histamine, IL-6 and IL-8\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Microdialysis levels of histamine, IL-6 and IL-8 assessed 1–3 h after cold challenge were significantly (P < 0.05) decreased following up-dosing with 80 mg bilastine.\"]\n]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[\n    [\"bilastine 20 mg\", \"placebo\", \"change in critical temperature thresholds (CTT)\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Bilastine 20 mg was highly effective (P < 0.0001) in reducing CTT.\"],\n    [\"bilastine 80 mg\", \"bilastine 20 mg\", \"change in critical temperature thresholds (CTT)\", \"significantly increased\", \"Up-dosing to 80 mg significantly (P < 0.04) increased its effectiveness.\"],\n    [\"bilastine 80 mg\", \"placebo\", \"levels of histamine, IL-6 and IL-8\", \"significantly decreased\", \"Microdialysis levels of histamine, IL-6 and IL-8 assessed 1–3 h after cold challenge were significantly (P < 0.05) decreased following up-dosing with 80 mg bilastine.\"]\n]"], "doc_hash": "7afa5c9c71f6f6b6d68e9d97374b7eeaf5b243e986676a99166b83361b9e0b73", "prompt_hash": "5610e69f431ae84db4836328a32896b50d95ae7ff4eb4ec40a13f8a7741e3e67", "target_hash": "67527271662f9a46f3dc7f1dc887e3eb286bbd55cc33680cb8f3b1de6fa12449", "bypass": null}

Grade 6 students aged 10–11 years of age (N = 2288) from 63 government primary schools in Perth, Western Australia, participated in the pre, post, and follow-up study. Schools were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: Aussie Optimism with teacher training, Aussie Optimism with teacher training plus coaching, or a usual care condition that received the regular Western Australian Health Education Curriculum. Students in the Aussie Optimism conditions received 20, 1-h lessons relating to social and interpersonal skills and optimistic thinking skills over the last 2 years of primary school. Parents in the active conditions received a parent information booklet each year, plus a self-directed program in Grade 7. Students and parents completed the Extended Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Students who scored in the clinical range on the Emotional Symptoms Scale were given The Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents IV, to assess suicidal ideation and behavior, and depressive and anxiety disorders. Results indicated that Aussie Optimism with teacher training plus coaching was associated with the best outcomes: a significant increase in student-reported pro-social behavior from pre-test to post-test 1 (maintained at post-test 2) and significantly lower incidence rates from suicidal ideation at post-test 2 and follow-up.

Twenty‐nine children 2 to 6 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis of ASD participated in this randomized, blinded, placebo‐controlled, crossover trial. Participants were randomized to receive AUCB or placebo, evaluated at baseline, 12, and 24 weeks, received the opposite infusion, then re‐evaluated at the same time points. Evaluations included assessments of safety, Expressive One Word Picture Vocabulary Test, 4th edition, Receptive One Word Picture Vocabulary Test, 4th edition, Clinical Global Impression, Stanford‐Binet Fluid Reasoning and Knowledge, and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior and Socialization Subscales. Generalized linear models were used to assess the effects of the response variables at the 12‐ and 24‐week time periods under each condition (AUCB, placebo). There were no serious adverse events. There were trends toward improvement, particularly in socialization, but there were no statistically significant differences for any endpoints. The results of this study suggest that autologous umbilical cord infusions are safe for children with ASD. Tightly controlled trials are necessary to further progress the study of AUCB for autism. stem\ncells\ntranslational\nmedicine\n2018;7:333–341\n\n\nFindings:\n[[\"AUCB\", \"Placebo\", \"Stanford Binet\\ufffdKnowledge\", \"no significant difference\", \"There were no statistically significant changes in the EOWPVT (Fig. 3A), ROWPVT (Fig. 3B), or Stanford Binet subscales (Fig. 3C, 3D) when subjects received placebo versus AUCB at 12 and 24 weeks post infusion.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.

This difference was entirely attributable to a difference between the two measures during the nocturnal period. Nocturnal gastric acid breakthrough was not a useful predictor of pathologic nocturnal esophageal reflux.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: In GERD subjects treated with a PPI, measuring time esophageal pH < 4 will significantly overestimate the prevalence of pathologic esophageal acid exposure over 24 hours and during the nocturnal period.\n\nFindings:", "output": "[[\"integrated acidity\", \"time pH \\u003c 4\", \"the prevalence of pathologic 24-hour esophageal reflux\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The prevalence of pathologic 24-hour esophageal reflux in both studies was significantly higher when measured as time pH \\u003c 4 than when measured as integrated acidity\"]]", "metadata": {"domains": ["clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "ie.relation_extraction"}, "_instance_id": "evidence_inference:validation:98"}, "target": "[[\"integrated acidity\", \"time pH \\u003c 4\", \"the prevalence of pathologic 24-hour esophageal reflux\", \"significantly decreased\", \"The prevalence of pathologic 24-hour esophageal reflux in both studies was significantly higher when measured as time pH \\u003c 4 than when measured as integrated acidity\"]]", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

This difference was entirely attributable to a difference between the two measures during the nocturnal period. Nocturnal gastric acid breakthrough was not a useful predictor of pathologic nocturnal esophageal reflux.\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: In GERD subjects treated with a PPI, measuring time esophageal pH < 4 will significantly overestimate the prevalence of pathologic esophageal acid exposure over 24 hours and during the nocturnal period.\n\nFindings:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["[[\"omeprazole or rabeprazole\", \"null\", \"prevalence of pathologic 24-hour esophageal reflux\", \"significantly increased\", \"The prevalence of pathologic 24-hour esophageal reflux in both studies was significantly higher when measured as time pH < 4 than when measured as integrated acidity.\"]]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[[\"omeprazole or rabeprazole\", \"null\", \"prevalence of pathologic 24-hour esophageal reflux\", \"significantly increased\", \"The prevalence of pathologic 24-hour esophageal reflux in both studies was significantly higher when measured as time pH < 4 than when measured as integrated acidity.\"]]"], "doc_hash": "cd8865e9fddb6c49ca9895604e7428953fde9aa27b2522ec7823a0cb7017397e", "prompt_hash": "66bd2fbd8459c99f567409c15784ff3929bded18a4aaf0ea1d0c51c2d071f4a4", "target_hash": "34c140df872e483be595e526be7231bc172bea36a11e89fe5cfe6a8cb1ef3ad4", "bypass": null}

Triphala mouthwash is used in the treatment of periodontal diseases because of its antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of triphala mouthwash with 0.2% chlorhexidine in hospitalized periodontal disease patients.\n\nABSTRACT.METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized, multicenter clinical trial, 120 patients were equally divided into three groups. Patients in group A were advised to rinse their mouths with 10 mL of distilled water, group B with 0.2% chlorhexidine, and group C with triphala mouthwash for 1 minute twice daily for two weeks. The plaque index (PI) and the gingival index (GI) were recorded on the first and the fifteenth day.\n\nABSTRACT.RESULTS: There was no significant difference when the efficacy of triphala was compared with 0.2% chlorhexidine in hospitalized patients with periodontal disease. However, a statistically significant difference was observed in PI and GI when both group B and group C were compared with group A and also within groups B and C, after 15 days (P<0.05).\n\nABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS: The triphala mouthwash (herbal) is an effective antiplaque agent like 0.2% chlorhexidine. It is significantly useful in reducing plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation, thereby controlling periodontal diseases in every patient. It is also cost effective, easily available, and well tolerable with no reported side effects.\n\nABSTRACT.GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT: \n\nFindings:\n[[\"rinse their mouths with 0.2% chlorhexidine for 1 minute twice daily for two weeks\", \"rinse their mouths with triphala mouthwash for 1 minute twice daily for two weeks \", \"periodontal disease\", \"no significant difference\", \"There was no significant difference when the efficacy of triphala was compared with 0.2% chlorhexidine in hospitalized patients with periodontal disease.\"]]\n\n\nYou will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report.
