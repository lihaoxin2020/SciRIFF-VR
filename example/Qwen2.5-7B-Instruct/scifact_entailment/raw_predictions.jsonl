Gastric bypass (6.56 kg/mo) and sleeve gastrectomy (6.29 kg/mo) were associated with greater initial weight reduction than gastric banding (2.77 kg/mo).\nProtective hazard ratios (HRs) were detected for bariatric surgery for incident T2DM, 0.68 (95% CI 0.55-0.83); hypertension, 0.35 (95% CI 0.27-0.45); angina, 0.59 (95% CI 0.40-0.87);MI, 0.28 (95% CI 0.10-0.74); and obstructive sleep apnoea, 0.55 (95% CI 0.40-0.87).\nStrong associations were found between bariatric surgery and the resolution of T2DM, with a HR of 9.29 (95% CI 6.84-12.62), and between bariatric surgery and the resolution of hypertension, with a HR of 5.64 (95% CI 2.65-11.99).\nNo association was detected between bariatric surgery and fractures, cancer, or stroke.\nEffect estimates for mortality found no protective association with bariatric surgery overall, with a HR of 0.97 (95% CI 0.66-1.43).\nThe data used were recorded for the management of patients in primary care and may be subject to inaccuracy, which would tend to lead to underestimates of true relative effect sizes.\nCONCLUSIONS Bariatric surgery as delivered in the UK healthcare system is associated with dramatic weight loss, sustained at least 4 y after surgery.\nThis weight loss is accompanied by substantial improvements in pre-existing T2DM and hypertension, as well as a reduced risk of incident T2DM, hypertension, angina, MI, and obstructive sleep apnoea.\nWidening the availability of bariatric surgery could lead to substantial health benefits for many people who are morbidly obese.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n--------------------\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["{\n  \"verdict\": \"NEI\",\n  \"evidence\": []\n}"]], "filtered_resps": ["{\n  \"verdict\": \"NEI\",\n  \"evidence\": []\n}"], "doc_hash": "bd3357df051e93883b60ba99805be3f95b9c70d3a794ec266aa171bd90c33a26", "prompt_hash": "923f946708b50ab615f52051bc99fe00bf2c856793565d98de56eed6414a2513", "target_hash": "2dd4c4d94186a2344d22765b178c20c1e35613163a5b083b2f1bd75fba26a6be", "bypass": null}

unhealthy lifestyle-related factors each have been linked to the risk of multiple chronic diseases and premature death, little is known about the combined impact on mortality outcomes, in particular among Chinese and other non-Western populations.\nThe objective of this study was to quantify the overall impact of lifestyle-related factors beyond that of active cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption on all-cause and cause-specific mortality in Chinese women.\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS We used data from the Shanghai Women's Health Study, an ongoing population-based prospective cohort study in China.\nParticipants included 71,243 women aged 40 to 70 years enrolled during 1996-2000 who never smoked or drank alcohol regularly.\nA healthy lifestyle score was created on the basis of five lifestyle-related factors shown to be independently associated with mortality outcomes (normal weight, lower waist-hip ratio, daily exercise, never exposed to spouse's smoking, higher daily fruit and vegetable intake).\nThe score ranged from zero (least healthy) to five (most healthy) points.\nDuring an average follow-up of 9 years, 2,860 deaths occurred, including 775 from cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 1,351 from cancer.\nAdjusted hazard ratios for mortality decreased progressively with an increasing number of healthy lifestyle factors.\nCompared to women with a score of zero, hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for women with four to five factors were 0.57 (0.44-0.74) for total mortality, 0.29 (0.16-0.54) for CVD mortality, and 0.76 (0.54-1.06) for cancer mortality.\nThe inverse association between the healthy lifestyle score and mortality was seen consistently regardless of chronic disease status at baseline.\nThe population attributable risks for not having 4-5 healthy lifestyle factors were 33% for total deaths, 59% for CVD deaths, and 19% for cancer deaths.\nCONCLUSIONS In this first study, to our knowledge, to quantify the combined impact of lifestyle-related factors on mortality outcomes in Chinese women, a healthier lifestyle pattern-including being of normal weight, lower central adiposity, participation in physical activity, nonexposure to spousal smoking, and higher fruit and vegetable intake-was associated with reductions in total and cause-specific mortality among lifetime nonsmoking and nondrinking women, supporting the importance of overall lifestyle modification in disease prevention.\nPlease see later in the article for the Editors' Summary.", "output": "{\"verdict\": \"SUPPORT\", \"evidence\": [\"Compared to

obesity epidemics.\nMuch of the risk for endometrial cancer development is influenced by the environment and lifestyle.\nAccumulating evidence suggests that the epigenome serves as the interface between the genome and the environment and that hypermethylation of stem cell polycomb group target genes is an epigenetic hallmark of cancer.\nThe objective of this study was to determine the functional role of epigenetic factors in endometrial cancer development.\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS Epigenome-wide methylation analysis of >27,000 CpG sites in endometrial cancer tissue samples (n = 64) and control samples (n = 23) revealed that HAND2 (a gene encoding a transcription factor expressed in the endometrial stroma) is one of the most commonly hypermethylated and silenced genes in endometrial cancer.\nA novel integrative epigenome-transcriptome-interactome analysis further revealed that HAND2 is the hub of the most highly ranked differential methylation hotspot in endometrial cancer.\nThese findings were validated using candidate gene methylation analysis in multiple clinical sample sets of tissue samples from a total of 272 additional women.\nIncreased HAND2 methylation was a feature of premalignant endometrial lesions and was seen to parallel a decrease in RNA and protein levels.\nFurthermore, women with high endometrial HAND2 methylation in their premalignant lesions were less likely to respond to progesterone treatment.\nHAND2 methylation analysis of endometrial secretions collected using high vaginal swabs taken from women with postmenopausal bleeding specifically identified those patients with early stage endometrial cancer with both high sensitivity and high specificity (receiver operating characteristics area under the curve = 0.91 for stage 1A and 0.97 for higher than stage 1A).\nFinally, mice harbouring a Hand2 knock-out specifically in their endometrium were shown to develop precancerous endometrial lesions with increasing age, and these lesions also demonstrated a lack of PTEN expression.\nCONCLUSIONS HAND2 methylation is a common and crucial molecular alteration in endometrial cancer that could potentially be employed as a biomarker for early detection of endometrial cancer and as a predictor of treatment response.\nThe true clinical utility of HAND2 DNA methylation, however, requires further validation in prospective studies.\nPlease see later in the article for the Editors' Summary.", "output": "{\"verdict\": \"SUPPORT\", \"evidence\": [\"METHODS AND FINDINGS Epigenome-wide methylation analysis of >27,000 CpG

Importantly, the most comprehensive model predicts that the current strategy of ART at CD4 count ≤350 cells/µl will also lead to elimination, albeit 10 y later compared to UTT.\nStill, UTT remains cost-effective, as many additional life-years would be saved.\nThe study's major limitations are that elimination was defined as incidence below 1/1,000 person-years rather than 0% prevalence, and drug resistance was not modeled.\nCONCLUSIONS Our results confirm previous predictions that the HIV epidemic in South Africa can be eliminated through universal testing and immediate treatment at 90% coverage.\nHowever, more realistic models show that elimination is likely to occur at a much later point in time than the initial model suggested.\nAlso, UTT is a cost-effective intervention, but less cost-effective than previously predicted because the current South African ART treatment policy alone could already drive HIV into elimination.\nPlease see later in the article for the Editors' Summary.", "output": "{\"verdict\": \"NEI\", \"evidence\": []}", "metadata": {"domains": ["biomedicine", "clinical_medicine"], "input_context": "paragraph", "output_context": "json", "source_type": "single_source", "task_family": "entailment"}, "_instance_id": "scifact_entailment:train:43"}, "target": "{\"verdict\": \"NEI\", \"evidence\": []}", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

Importantly, the most comprehensive model predicts that the current strategy of ART at CD4 count ≤350 cells/µl will also lead to elimination, albeit 10 y later compared to UTT.\nStill, UTT remains cost-effective, as many additional life-years would be saved.\nThe study's major limitations are that elimination was defined as incidence below 1/1,000 person-years rather than 0% prevalence, and drug resistance was not modeled.\nCONCLUSIONS Our results confirm previous predictions that the HIV epidemic in South Africa can be eliminated through universal testing and immediate treatment at 90% coverage.\nHowever, more realistic models show that elimination is likely to occur at a much later point in time than the initial model suggested.\nAlso, UTT is a cost-effective intervention, but less cost-effective than previously predicted because the current South African ART treatment policy alone could already drive HIV into elimination.\nPlease see later in the article for the Editors' Summary.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n--------------------\n\n"], "do_sample": false, "max_gen_toks": 1024}}}, "resps": [["{\n  \"verdict\": \"NEI\",\n  \"evidence\": []\n}"]], "filtered_resps": ["{\n  \"verdict\": \"NEI\",\n  \"evidence\": []\n}"], "doc_hash": "6b6bdcb71e83271cb41caced52c9c1df85b6d957c392aa2b8ba852ccb56265c1", "prompt_hash": "069fec4c89e095c22541f72ed545d386263d4ff728b2e6d59bdc37a9e96abb27", "target_hash": "593df50cd4ccef8fcad75c0e5e227805a98dd643608f9c6d9f6dba423f3502ca", "bypass": null}

51 patients in the control group received anti-IL-2 receptor antibody plus standard-dose CNIs.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary measure was 1-year incidence of acute rejection and renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]); the secondary measure was patient and graft survival and incidence of adverse events.\nRESULTS Patient and graft survival at 13 to 30 months was similar in all groups.\nAfter 6 months, 4 of 53 patients (7.5%) in the autologous MSC plus standard-dose CNI group (95% CI, 0.4%-14.7%; P = .04) and 4 of 52 patients (7.7%) in the low-dose group (95% CI, 0.5%-14.9%; P = .046) compared with 11 of 51 controls (21.6%; 95% CI, 10.5%-32.6%) had biopsy-confirmed acute rejection.\nNone of the patients in either autologous MSC group had glucorticoid-resistant rejection, whereas 4 patients (7.8%) in the control group did (95% CI, 0.6%-15.1%; overall P = .02).\nRenal function recovered faster among both MSC groups showing increased eGFR levels during the first month after surgery than the control group.\nPatients receiving standard-dose CNI had a mean difference of 6.2 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) (95% CI, 0.4-11.9; P=.04) and those in the low-dose CNI of 10.0 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) (95% CI, 3.8-16.2; P=.002).\nAlso, during the 1-year follow-up, combined analysis of MSC-treated groups revealed significantly decreased risk of opportunistic infections than the control group (hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.20-0.85, P=.02)   CONCLUSION Among patients undergoing renal transplant, the use of autologous MSCs compared with anti-IL-2 receptor antibody induction therapy resulted in lower incidence of acute rejection, decreased risk of opportunistic infection, and better estimated renal function at 1 year.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00658073.", "output": "{\"verdict\": \"SUPPORT\", \"evidence\": [\"After 6 months, 4 of 53 patients (7.5%) in the autologous MSC plus standard-dose CNI group (95% CI, 0.4%-14.7%;
